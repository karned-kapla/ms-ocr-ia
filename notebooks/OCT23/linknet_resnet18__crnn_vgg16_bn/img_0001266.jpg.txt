Canada, "PIT the second-larg-
est cigarette sompany in that
country, contracied yesterday
with the Strickman Foundation

for use of the filter invénted
by Robert L. Strickman.
The company, which is 5Q
per cent British-owned, but
Canadian-managed, sells 12 bil-
lion cigarettes a year, very few
of them in the United States.
The agreement was the second
bs two days with the founda-
tion. On Wednesday the foun-
dation signed with the
Imperial Tobacco Company of
Canada, Ltd., that country's
largest cigarette company, with
annual salcs of more tan 18
billion cigarettes.
That first contract was over-
shadowed by the announcement;
that Columbia University, at
the request of Mr. Strickman,
was surrendering its rights to
the filter to the fonndetion.
The university said # had
"made a well-intentioned mis-
take in entering a highly con-
troversial end competitive com-
mercial fieid."
