risD. Girolamo, Sosh Onange,
I'm aware that my answer is going to
drive everyone crazy, but I'm going
torisk is anyway: It will take him 30
days. To explain, let's suppose that
the well da oaly 2 foet doep. How
many days will it take him de jump
out? Less than one, because he an
land * the bottom, then jump up to
the edge and climb right out without
sliding back at all. If the well is 3
foet doep, bowever, he'l jump up 2
foct & slide down one during the
finst 24-bour period, then jump out -
wben the next day arriyes, with only
one full day behind him. if the well
is4 foct deep, n talke bim two
days, and so pa. the number of days
alwiys being two less than the foet.
