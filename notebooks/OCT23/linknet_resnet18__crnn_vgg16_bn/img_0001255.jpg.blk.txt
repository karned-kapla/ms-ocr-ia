DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS, PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS LISON THORNTON, PETER Leg* and JOEN FRY P N L Statistics and Computing Lad, 17 Ceder Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Receaed in restsed farin & March 1994) Abstract Ã  extent to wich current, ex and passive smoking are associatod with otber risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studiod using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 31 lifestyle (actors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never amokers living with - smoker ("passive smokens") and other never smokers. or the 33 nisk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than l. never smokers and only twa showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, decreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased in passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated. It is concluded that confounding by multipke risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak associations are obscrved. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
