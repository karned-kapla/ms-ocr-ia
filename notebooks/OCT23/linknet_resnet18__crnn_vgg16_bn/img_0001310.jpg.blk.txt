Box 8025 Dep., Oslo 1, Norway 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors was used to update earlier conclusions from sisilar surveys in 1952' and 19747 The 1984 survey included for the first tin questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of Ã  stratifind sample of sesbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 435 female and 869 male physicians, As saoking varies systematic ally by age, the general population Mas ageadjusted ta match the doctors' age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper aay
therefore differ from official Norwegian figures.
RECILTS Sroking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors were ssokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were ssokers Only 11.41 ot female doctors saoked compared to 411 of all Norwegian vonen. There seeas to be widening gap between the doctors and the lay population, because the differences are are marked in the younger age groups, and because ore doctors than lay persons MAnt to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and ta 1974 there wAs in 1984 a further considerabl decrease in the proportion of doctors wha saoke, both within and across age cohorts. (not the sase persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age and older. The decrease in smoking among sales is much sterper buose doctors than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in the feaale population, and reducing sharply suose female phycicians, (Fig. 1) 251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are noM ex-smokers, from this it may be inferred that 2. 400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors who continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The -An consumption per saoker was 14 cigarettes per day for sale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fesale doctors. This difference is alaost ident ical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 yeArs, only 111 of sale doctors and 41 of female doctors who saoke were certain that they would ssoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 545 of the women think it likely or certain that they will quit smoking. IE their own predictions were truc, the overall rates of buryons in 1989 vould be 115 for male doctors and 55 for fesale doctors.
