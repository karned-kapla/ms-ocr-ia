Surmary: Specificity of 1.2-diacylglyerol for the activation of
protein kinass was investigated wich various synthetic products.

derived from thn recaptor-badiated hydrolysis of inositol phospho-
lipids was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids were almost equaily active in this
rola. ormone-saniitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerol: during lipolysis. The lack of the specifici -
