Intracellular signal transduction pathways have central roles in processes
such as growth, differentiation, neurotransmission and development. The
aberrant expression of components of various signal transduction pathways
has profound consequences for cellular functions Recent findings indicate
that Auew cases of neoplasia and inherited diseases have, at their roots,
mutations la key steps of signalling pathways.
