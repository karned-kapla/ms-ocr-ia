RESILTS: Sroking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were snokera. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian vonen. There seens to be A widening gap between the doctors and the lay population, because the differences are - narked in the younger age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit smoking. In comparisor both to 1952 and to 1974 there was in 1984 a (urther considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts.
