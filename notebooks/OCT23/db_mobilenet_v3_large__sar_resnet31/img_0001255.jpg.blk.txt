DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS, PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS ALISON THORNTON, PETER LEE* and JOIN FRY P. N. Lee Statistics and Computing Lad, 17 Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey UNS SDA, England (Recened b restsed form & March 1994) Abstract-The extent 03 which current, B and passive smoking are associatod with other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 33 lifestyle factors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, docreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased in passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated It is concluded that confounding by multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak associations are obscrved. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of pasive smoking with various hcakh effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
