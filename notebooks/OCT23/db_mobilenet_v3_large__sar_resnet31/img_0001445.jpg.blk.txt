Abstract- Evidence of noncomparability of sell-formed smoker and nonsmoker groups of adolescents from the Child Health and Development Studies of the University of Califomia. Berkeley. was found in a study of antecedent psychosocial characteristics (observed at JRE 10) before the adoption of the smoking habit. With possible confounding factors controlled. eventual smokers showed significantly greater prevalence than nonsmokers of Type A personality traits. eutraversion. psychoticism. anger. and restless sleep Eventual smokers were lower in socio- economic status than nonsmokers. and also eshibited significantly lower mtan scores for the Raven Progressive Matrices and Peabody Picture Vocabulary tests For cach trait. the trends of the data were consistent in boys and girls Since Aurw of these traits are shown to "track" into adult lile. where they are tben related oi coronary heart disease. the role of self-sclection requires further consideration in causal inferences about smoking and coronary heart discase
INTROD CCTION
N] RECENT years. many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [I. 2]. in the Framingham Study. univariate and multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho- social factors to CHD and also ol cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive question of temporal precedence and a priori self-selection still requires further clarification. however. In the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with nonsmokers. In these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts ofsmokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has been available. however. to The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) of the University of Califomia, Berkeley. provide an opportunity o check this assumption by examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS is a prospective investigation of children from birth to late adolescence At snouea stages of their development, the children were examined as to their biological, social. and In this report, we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics of a large cohort of boys and girls before some of them later began cigarette smoking as teenagers Reprint requests should be addressed to: Frank a Oechsli, Child Health and Development Studies, This project  11 supported be Grant E from the Peabody Museum.
