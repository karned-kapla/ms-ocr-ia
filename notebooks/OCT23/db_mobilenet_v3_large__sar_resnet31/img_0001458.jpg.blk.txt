think there will be a desire by many 5 Congress to "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventually materializes, which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing is a good example of a way to stay busy 5 DC Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can delve into and get better personal news coverage, while any action on our issues is likely of get buried, but you never
know!
