- think there will be a desire by many in Congress to "stay relevant" 8 whatever war effort eventually materializes, which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing is a good example of la way 8. stay busy 55 DC. Ithink it le unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can deive into and get better personal news coverage, while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never
know!
