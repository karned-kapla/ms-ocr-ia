Sumary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinasa C was investigated with various synthetic products. "IGARDATSTAsoprgosonveis-T a major species of diacylglycerol derived from the receptor-mediated ETUAToxphu of inositol phospho- lipids, : most active, but many other discylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acida vere almost aqually active in this role. Hormone-sensitive 1ipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidonyl spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinasa C indeed comas in contact in the nembrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase c to modulate many Ca2*-dependent cellular processes (1).
