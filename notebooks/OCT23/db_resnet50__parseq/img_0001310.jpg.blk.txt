National Council on Seoking and Health, P.O. Box 8025 Dep.. Oslo 1, Norway < 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions from sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first time questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind sample of nenbers of the Norvegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians. As smoking varies systematic. ally by age, the general population MAS ageadjusted to match the doctors' age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may
therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.
RESULTS: Sroking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norwegian popula tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian women. There seeas to be A widening deb between the doctors and the lay population, because the differences are more marked in the younger age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there was in 1984A further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age and older. The decrease in smoking BUONP males is auch steeper buoar doctors than in the Norvegian sale population. Saoking proportions : increasing in the feaale population, and reducing sharply anong fenale physicians. (Fig. 1) 251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-smokers, fron this it may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption per saoker was 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fenale doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. When asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors and 41 of fenale doctors whosnoke were certain that they would smoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vomen think it likely or certain that they vill quit smoking. It their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of snoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
