Air is nontoxic and is necassary to support Iife, Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such a3 pressures which may existin hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposuro to high-pressure environments of air where the panial pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur. bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air is breathed 5 high-pressure anvironments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons) should be prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be recuired.
