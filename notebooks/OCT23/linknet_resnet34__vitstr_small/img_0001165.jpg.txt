-risD. Girolamo, South Ordige, NJ
I'm aware that my answer is going to
drive everyone crary, but I'm
to risk it anyway: It will take him
days. To explain, let's suppose that
the well is oaly 2 foet doep. How
many days will i take him te jump
out? Less than one, because he can
land e the botiom, then jump dn 8
the edge and climb right out without
sliding back et all. If the well is 3
foet deep. bowever, he'll jump dn 2
foet and slide down onc during the
firs 24-bour period, then jump out
wben the next day arrives, with only
one full day behind him. If the well
is4 foet deep, m, take bim two
days, and so o0. .the number of days
alwiys being two less than the feet.
