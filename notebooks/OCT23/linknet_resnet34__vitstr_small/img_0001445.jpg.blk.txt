Abstract -Evidence of noncomparability of self-formed smoker and nonsmoker groups of adolescents from the Child Health and Development Studies of the University of Califemia, Berkeley. was found in - study of antecedent psychosocial characteristics (observed at age 10i before the adoption of the smoking habit. With possible confounding factors controlled, eventual smokers showed significantly greuter prevalence than nonsmokers of Type A personality traits. extraversion. psychoticism. anger. and restless sleep. Eventual smokers were lower in socio economic status than nonsmokers. and alwo eshibited significantly lower mean scres for the Raven Progressive Matrices and Peabody Picture Vocabulary tests For each trait, the trends of the data were consistent in boys and girls Since many of these traits are shown te "track into adult lile, where they are tben rdated 2 coronary heart disease. the role of self-sclection requires further consideration in causal inferences about smoking and coronary heart discase.
INTRODUCTION
INi RECENT years, many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD (I. 2] In the Framingham Study. univariate and multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho- social factors to CHD and also to cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive question of temporal precedence and a priori self-selection still requires further clarification. however. In the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with nonsmokers. in these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has been available. however. to The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) of the University of Califomia. Berkeley, provide an opportunity 01 check this assumption by examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS is a prospective investigation of children from birth to late adolescence. At various stages of their development, the children were examined as 01 their biological, social. and In this report. we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics of a large cohort of boys and girls before some of them later began cigarette smoking as teenagers Reprint requests should be addressed to: Frank w.
