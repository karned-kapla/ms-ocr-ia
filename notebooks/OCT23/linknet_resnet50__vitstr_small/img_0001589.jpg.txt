A school and community based intervention to influence health behavior and cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) risk factors in 13- to 15-year-old children was carried out in North
Karelia, Finland. The intervention was carried out on two levels: (a) an intensive interven-
tion (II) in two schools and (b) a county-wide intervention (CI) in the rest of North Karelia.
