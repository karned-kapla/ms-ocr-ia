Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Iife, Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr in high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result in decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of air where the panial pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acousticat distur.
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facilities at which air is breathed In high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and caissons)
should be prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be recuired.

may also result In nitrogen narcosis.
