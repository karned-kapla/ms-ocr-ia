1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions fron
similar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of nembers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed
questionnaire, 435 female and 969 male physicians, As smoking varies systrmatic
ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted 03 natch the doctors' 4ge
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.

BESILTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of nale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norwegian popula
tion at large 461 were snokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to
411 of all Norwegian vonen. There seeas to be a widening deb betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences : nore marked in the younger
agc groups, and berause nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit snoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in smoking buowe males is much sterper buony doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Snoking proportions are increasing in
thr female population, and reducing sharply buone female physicians. (Fig. 11
251 of male and 151 of female doctors are now ex-smokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per snoker was 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and 03 the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their snoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and Ã  of fenale doctors whossoke vere certain that they would snoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they
vill quit smoking. If their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
A : feature of the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors"
