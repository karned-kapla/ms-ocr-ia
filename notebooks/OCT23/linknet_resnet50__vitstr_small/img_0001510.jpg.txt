ASBESTOS workers are unintentional victims of
industrial progress. They are at risk of pulmonary
fbrrosis, pleural calcification, mesothellomas and lung
cancer. Asbestos exposure is now widespread,
involving not only air but also
wine and beer.' Fibers have been found in the
lungs of people without inclustrial asbestos ex-
posure. Whatever the exact nature of asbestos or
ferruginous bodies may be, there la no doubt that

presence of asbestos in their lungs is disturbing.
Asbestos is relatively resistant to destruction by
most chemical and physical means and can float
freely in the atmosphere for prolonged periods.
Asbestos discases have a long latent
