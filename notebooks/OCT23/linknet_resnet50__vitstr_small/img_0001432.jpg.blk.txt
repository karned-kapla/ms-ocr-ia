Photon Counting SPF A very practical tool of great usable range .s 200 to 650 nanometers for corrected value in those applications which are sensitivity-or excitation spectra, and 290 to 700 nanometers for cor-
scatter-limited. This instrument detects fluorescence rected emission spectra.
signals too weak to measure by conventional tech- niques; has the greater stability inherent to pulse- height discrimination; and reduces noise by observing ohly photo cathode impulses which are averaged,
Ratio SPF The ratio photometer provides superior stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer to known spectral characteristics, partially corrects for low intensity peak shift in far UV and increases the sig-
Corrected Spectra SPF A third generation corrected nal-to-noise ratio. The photometer operates in either spectra instrument which produces either quanta-cor- the conventional single beam mode or ratio mode and rected or energy-corrected excitation and emission has four time constants to provide optimum noise -dns spectra without the use of quantum counters.
