The presence of different monooxygenase activities has been docu- mented in buman placental microsomes. The predominating cytochrome P- 450, that of androgen aromatase, catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens (1). Aromatase P-450 bas been tbe object of numerous studies to determine its mechanism of action and to purify it (2, 3). Gough et al. [4) reportd the presence of another enzyme system which catalyzes the hydroxylation of xenobiotic substances. It has also been reported that a placental cytochrome P-450 is responsible for the hydroxylation of benzo(a)pyrene via aryl hydro- carbon hydroxylase "IL-S The low content of the responding cytochrome P. 450 in human placenta and instability during purification have made it dificuut to isolate any other active P-450 enzyme. As a side beneft gained from our procedure to purify and characterize catalytically active aromatase P-450 "()) we found a fraction from the immunoaffintty chromatography which showed a high level of xenobiotic activity with little contaminating aromatase activity. Through the use ofconventional puritcattion procedures. we obtained a xenobiotically active P-450 with no aromatase activity. Previous studies on aryl hydrocarbon bydroxylase activity have demon- strated higher levels of this activity in amokers but not in nonsmokers '8l "(6 'Postdoctoral Researcb Fellows on leave from tbe Department of Obsteincs and
