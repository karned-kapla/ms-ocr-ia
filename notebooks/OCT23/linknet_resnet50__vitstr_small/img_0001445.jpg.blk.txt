INTRODUCTION
IN RECENT years, many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [.. 2]. In the Framingham Study. univariate and multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho- social factors to CHD and also to cigurette smoking [3- 5). The pervasive question of temporal precedence and a priori self-selection still requires further clarification, however. In the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with nonsmokers. in these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has been available. however. to The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) of the University of Califomia. Berkeley, provide un opportunity to check this assumption by examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS is a prospective investigation of children from birth to late adolescence. At various stages of their development, the children were examined SE to their biological. social. and in this report, we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics of a large cohort of boys and girls before some of them later began cigarette smoking as teenagers.
