derived from the recaptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho-
1ipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this
role. Hormone-sensitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of a specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stsaroyl-srachidonyll
spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the mambrane vhen the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dis-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into 5 phospholipid
It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
