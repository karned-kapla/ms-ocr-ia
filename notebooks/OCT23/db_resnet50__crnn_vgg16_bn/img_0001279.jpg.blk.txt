Surmary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycarol for the activation of protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products. Toisokrbrsoprsoes:-F-Tioimis- a major species of diacylglycerol derived trom the Fecaptor-aediated syektoxpky of inositol phospho- lipids, : most active, but many other aiacylglycerols having naturaily occurring fatty acids vere almost aquaily active in this role. omone-sentitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerola during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the staroyl-arachiasey spacios is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed cones in contact in the membrane when the receptor is stimulated, and that diacyiglyoceroi. from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is generally accepted that receptor-sediated hydrolysis of inositol phoapholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many ca2*-dependent cellular processes (1).
