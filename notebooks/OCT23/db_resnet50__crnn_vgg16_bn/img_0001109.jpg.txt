For a number of genetically influenced illnesses, age of onset is correlated between
relatives. bn some cases, age of onset also serves : an index of an individual's
inherited liabiliry t0 an illness. Typically, survival models for age of onset distri-
butions do not allour for these effecte. We have used the gamma distribution as the
basis of a model which specifies genetic variabiliry in aBe of onset. Specifically,
we aliow the hazard frequency parameter of the gamma distribution to be a
monotonic function of an individual's inherited liabiliry 9 an illness.

INTRODUCTION

Genetic analyses of illnesses and behaviors showing a variable age of onset
require a knowledge of the cumulative probability of onset by given ages. Some
approach√®s [Weinberg. 1915; Stromgren, 1938; Risch, 1983) derive this probability
from prior age of onset distributions. Others (Elston, 1973; Heimbuch et al., 1980;
Risch, 1983) estimate parameters of a cumulative age of onset distribution from the
data. When the data allow its use, the latter method le more appealing since specific
