National Council on Seoking and Health, P.0. Box 8025 Dep.. Oslo 1, Norway - 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors Mas used to update earlier conclusions fros siailar surveys in 1952' and 19747. The 1984 survey included for the first tin questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients, 911 of a stratifind sample of seabers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 male physicians. As smoking varies systematic ally by age, the general population Mas ageadjusted to match the doctors" age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may
therefore differ from official Norwegian figures.
RECULTS: Smoking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of male doctors were ssokers, whereas in the Norwegian popula tion at large 461 were ssokers. Only 11.41 of female doctors saoked compared to 411 of all Norwegian women. There seeas to be a widening dub between the doctors and the lay population, because the ditterences àre more sarked in the younger age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there was in 1984 further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both withip and across age cohorts. (not the sase persons), with the exception of persons 65 ysars of age and older. The decrease in smoking buone sales is much steeper buose doctors than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions : increasing in the feaale population, and reducing sharply among female physicians. (Fig. 1) 251 of sale and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-smokers, from this it may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors who continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco -s. the mean consumption per saoker was 14 cigarettes per day for sale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fesale doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 yeArs, only 111 of sale doctors and 41 of female doctors whosnoke were certain that they would ssoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 545 of the women think it likely or certain that they will quit smoking. IE their own predictions were true, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 vould be 115 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors. Anew feature ot the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors"
