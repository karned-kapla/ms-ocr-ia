- think there will be a desire by many in Congress to "stay relevant d8 whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing ie a good
example of la way 8. stay busy 5 DC. Ithink it le unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
deive into and get better personal news coverage. while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never

know!
