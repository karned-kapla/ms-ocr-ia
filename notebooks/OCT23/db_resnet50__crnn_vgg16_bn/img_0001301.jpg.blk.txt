TF Song nodern workers suggest that nocurate mensurement of vibrational frequency (in the far Intrared, for exanple) of an unknown odorant will pernit prediction of its quallty and intenslty. T E No elenentel substance, not even halldes or ozone hos any odor; Instead they react with the mucoss foraing new products whlch are smellod; but T F Sone odorants have sterlc or vibrational propertles which force the concluslon that they are odorless whon they are not. 11. T F Present evidence strongly suggests thet different parts of the olfactory receptor ares, IIke tho retina In he eye, are quellty-specifie. TF Odorents need not penetrate the mucous (liquid system) nor the receptor 7F No one yet has a fir clue as fo the criticot relation between the molecule and the receptor which permits an odor perception. TF The greeter the secretion rate of nucous or sallve, the higher their pH, and both pHI and tomperature influence the quallty of sensafion in the 111. TF The Ideal instrumentel detector would respond to odors in the sane quantitetlve range as does an eninal or human subject. TF Such an Ideat detecror has not been developed.
