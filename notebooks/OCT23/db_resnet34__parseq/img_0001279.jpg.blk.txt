Sumary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinasa C was investigated with various synthetic products. i-Stearoyl-2-arachidonylglycerol. e major species of diacylglycerol derived from I receptor-mediated ETUAToxphu of inositol phospho- lipids, was sost active, but many other diacylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acida vere almost aqually active in this role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidonyl spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the nembrane when the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally acceptad that receptor-mediated hydrolvsis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2+ "-dependent cellular processes (1).
