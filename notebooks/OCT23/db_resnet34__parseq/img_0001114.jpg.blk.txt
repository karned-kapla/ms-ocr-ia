Inhalation of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result U) decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure envirooments of alr where the panlal pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustica! distur. bances, abnomat sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment (ead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air is breathed in high-pressure environmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should 3 prepared to deal with Ilinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
