National Council uo Seoking and Health, P.0. Box 8025 Dep.. Oslo 1 Norway A 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors VAS used to update earlier conclusions from similar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first time questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients 911 of a stratifind sample of aenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians, As saoking varies systenatic ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted to match the doctors' age distribution. The figures aiven for the general population in this paper may In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors were seokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were smokers Only 11.41 of fenale doctors saoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian women. There seeas to be A widening gap between the doctors and the lay population, because the ditterences are more marked in the younger age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there was in 1984 a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age than in the Norvegian sale population. Saoking proportions are increasing in the feaale population, and reducing sharply Buowe fenale physicians (Fig. 1) 251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are DOW ex-ssokers, fron this it may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho continue smoking have aot à down on their tobacco use à mean consumption per saoker was 14 cigarettes pet day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fenale doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors and 41 of fenale doctors whosmoke were certain that they would smoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the women think it likely or certain that they vill quit smoking. It their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 would be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors A new feature ot the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors
