Alr (s nontoxic and Is necassary to support Iife. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
existin hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. inhalation of alrin high-pressure
envtronmenta can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro
duce a variety of centrat nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur.
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination. confusion, muscle twitching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be presant when confusion and impaired Judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facillties at which air ls breathed 5 high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons)
should be prepared to deal with Illnesses resulting from decompreasion. Decompreasion equipment may be required.
