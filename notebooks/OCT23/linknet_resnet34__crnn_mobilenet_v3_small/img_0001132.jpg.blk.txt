THE MIGRATION OF TOBACCO-SPECIFIC NITROSAMINES INTO THE SALIVA OF CHEWERS OF NICOTINE-CONTAINING CHEWING GUM Swedish National Food Administration, Box 622, S-751 26 Uppsala, Sweden (Received 14 November 1989; revisions received 22 May 1990)

Abstract- -In many countries nicotine-containing chewing gum (Nicorette*) is used to help to break the habit of smoking. Saliva was collected every Smin from chewers of nicotine chewing gum and analysed for tobacco-speciflc nitrosamines. Detectable levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines were found in all samples collected between 5 and 15min after chewing had started. The levels of N"aitrosonornicotine ranged from 0.4 to 19ng/g of saliva and thuse for the uns of N-eitrosoanatabine plus N-nitrosoan- abasine from 1.3 to 46ng/g A(amndytKalrossedeon) 1O-pyldyf-butanome was not detected in the saliva. The nicotine chewing gum was found to contain dn to 380 ng tobacco-specific nitrosamines/g of
chewing gum.
