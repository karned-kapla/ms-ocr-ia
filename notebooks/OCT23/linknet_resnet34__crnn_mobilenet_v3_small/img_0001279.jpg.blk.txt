Summary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase c vas investigated with various synthatic products. -Btaroyl-s-arschidneylgiyearol, a major species of diacylglycerol derived from the receptor-sediated hydrolysia of inositol phospho- lipids was most active, but many other discylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active 5 this role. Bormone-sensitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylgiycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stevropl-arachianeyl spacies is the diacylglycerol vith which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the nambrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that discylglycerols from other sources are produced in dis- tinct compartsents and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation to modulate many Ca**-dependent cellular processes (1). However, the physiological pictare as vell as the This investigation was supported in part by research grants from the Scientific Research Fund of Ministry of Education, Sciece and Culture, Japan (1986-1967) Muscular Dystrophy Association (1986-1987), Yananouchi Foundation 5 taken in part from the dissertation that vill be subaitted by * Go to Kobe University School of Medicise in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the 1 Present address: Department of Internal Medicine, First Division, Kobe Abbreviations used are: EGTA, ethylene glycol bis (B-aminoethyl ether)- N,N.KT E -tetraacetic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; and
