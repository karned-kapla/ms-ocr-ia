"Everyone Seems Defeated'
When Mark Donnelly came of age in the
1960s. no problem seemed insoluble. In
1962, as a 20-year-old Army private, Mr.
Donnelly went to Oxford, Miss., 0 protect
James Meredith. whose enroilment at the
University of Mississippi sparked race
riots. For a week, Mr. Donnelly stood
outside Mr. Meredith s dormitory with a
Tifle guarding him against attack. One
student spat on him. he recalls.
Mr. Donnelly also served in Vietnant.
But after his discharge. he marched on

place, says Mr. Donnelly, now a 50-year-
old vice president at Chemical Bank in
New York City. "We naively thought that
problems were solvable.
Today, his view is different. The
lems he sees - the budget deficit, strato-
spheric health-care costs, the AIDS
demic and deficient schools - seem insu-
perable. The assumption that prosperity
would cure social ills has hit the wall of
reality in the form of intractable urban
poverty and a fury that erupted in Los
Angeles this spring. The proportion of
households mun annual incomes under
$15,000 was lower in 1990, after adjustment
for inflation, than in 1980 or 1970, but It
remained stubbornly close i6 25%.
"I've become very cynical about the
ability of our system to bring about
change,' Mr. Donnelly says. "There's a

For many Americans the future seems
about as secure as a dandelion puff.
An entire generation now reaching
middle age is questioning whether they or
their children can do better than their
parents. Job security went out with three-
plece suits. and pundits have coined a new
term, dumpies for downwardly mobile
professionals. Today, both mother and
father work, not to be rich, but e send kids
60 college. The complicated family seene
looks more like an Andy Warhol canvas
than a Norman Rockwell portrait.
Statistically, Americans. both rich and
poor, are improving their lots. Their
buying power has doubled since the 1950s,
and their standard of living remains the
highest in the world. Others outside the
U.S. still believe people can improve their
lot in America: The current wave of immi-
grants i the largest since early this cen-
Even S many Americans despair
about the future. In part that's because, in
relative terms, America sa standard of liv-
ing isn't as far ahead of everyone else - as
it once was: other countries are catching
up. Nor is the U.S. rate of growth as rapid
as i= once was. And even somne affluent
Americans have discovered, a their par
ents warned, that money doesa 't buy hap
piness. The same numbers - one 5 three
Amertcans - told researchers at the Na-
tional Opinion Research Center they were
"very happy" in both 1957 and 1990. No
amount of money ensures happiness. con-
cludes David G. Myers in his book "The
Pursuit of Happiness rather, happiness
is satisfaction with whatever one has.
Warren Benais, a business professor at
the University of Southern California, has
another explanation for this widespread
and Mahler-like melancholy. Recalling a
sunny phraseol the 1930s - A long sum-
mer of the future" - he says today that
