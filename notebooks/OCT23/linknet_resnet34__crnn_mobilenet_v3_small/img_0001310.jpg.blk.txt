National Council uo Snoking and Health, P.0. Box 8025 Dep., Oslo : Norvay A 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vaS used 8 update earlier conclusions fton sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974. The 1984 survey included for the first tin questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind sample of nembers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the nailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians. As saoking varies systematic- ally by age, the general population v1S ageadjusted 03 satch the doctors' age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors were smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were snokers Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian vonen. There secas to be a widening gap between the doctors : the lay population, because the differences are nore narked in the younger age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit saoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age and older. The decrease in snoking buowe nales is nuch stceper buonv doctors than in the Norvegian nale population. Saoking proportions are increasing in the female population, and reducing sharply among fenale physicians. (Fig. = 251 of sale and 151 of fenale doctors are nov ex-saokers, fron this it nay be inferred that 2 400 Norwegian doctors have quit suoking. The doctors vho continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption per snoker vas M cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost identical to the doctors' con- sunption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of sale doctors and 41 of female doctors who_snoke were certain that they would snoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the wonen think it likely or certain that they will quit amoking. If their oun predictions were true, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
