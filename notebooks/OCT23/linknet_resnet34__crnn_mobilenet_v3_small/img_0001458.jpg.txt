Ithink there will be a desire by many in Congress o "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler.' and a hearing is a good
example of a way 8. stay busy in DC. Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
deive into and get better personal news coverage. while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never

know!
