I'm aware that my answer is going to
drive everyone crazy, but I'm going
to risk it anyway: It will take him 30
days. To explain, let's suppose that
the well is oaly 2 foet doep. How
many days will it take him to jump
out? Less than ope, because he can
land at the bottom, then jump up to
the edge and climb right tout without
sliding back a all.  the well is 3
foet deep, bowever. he'l jump up2
foct and slide down one during the
finst 24-bour period, then jump out
ben the next day arrives, with only
one full day behind him. A the well
is4 foct deep, n take him two
days, and so 00. the number ofdays
alwiys being two less than the feet.
