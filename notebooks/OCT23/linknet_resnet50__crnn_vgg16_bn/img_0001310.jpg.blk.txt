National Council on Seoking and Health, P.O. Bar 8025 Dep Oslo - Norway 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors Mas used to update earlier conclusions from siailar surveys in 1952' and 19747. The 1984 survey included for the first tins questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients, 911 of à stratifind saaple of seabers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 sale physicians, As saoking varies systematic ally by age, the general population Mas ageadjusted o match the doctors' age distrihution. The figures given for the general population in this paper ay
therefore differ from official Norwegian figures.
BECILTS: Seoking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of male doctors were smokers. whereas in the Norwegian popula tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of female doctors saoked compared to 411 of all Norwegian vomen. There seeas to be a widening dwb betveen the doctors and the lay population, because the differences : more marked in the younger age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there wAs in 1984 a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both withip and across age cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ysars of age and older. The decrease in smoking buone sales is much steeper buosr doctors than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in the fcaale population, and reducing sharply suose female physicians. (Fig. 1) 251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-smokers, from this ie may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors who continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The -An consumption per smoker was 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fesale doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and o3 the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 yeArs, only 111 of sale doctors and 41 of female doctors whosmoke were certain that they would ssoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 545 of the women think it likely or certain that they will quit saoking. IE their own predictions were truc, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 vould be 115 for aale doctors and 51 for fesale doctors. A € feature ot the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors*
