Photon Counting SPF A very practical tool of great usablo range le 200 to 650 nanometers for corrected

niques; has the greater stability inherent to pulse-

Ohly photo cathode impulses which are averaged.

Ratio SPF The ratio photometer provides superior
stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer
to known spectral characteristics, partially corrects for
low intensity peak shift le far UV and increases the sig-
