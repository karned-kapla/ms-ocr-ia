Alr is nontoxle and is necessary to support Hfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments. such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresutt In simllar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr In high-pressure emironmenti can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the pantlal pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur. bances, abnormal sensations, impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twltching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facillties at which air Is breathed in high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwate diving. and calssons) should be prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompression, Decompression equipment may be reguired.
