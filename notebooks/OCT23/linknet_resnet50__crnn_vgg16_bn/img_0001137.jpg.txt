Objective: To investigate the relationship between mutagenicity and weight of tobacco
Summary: Mutagenicity estimates using a nonlinear regression model were obtained on
sample of 24 RJR products. Correlations between mutagenicity (estimated from linear
and nonlinear regression models) and weight of tobacco burned, tar, cigarette length and air
dilution were determined. Preliminary regression analyses were performed to investigate

burned, tar, cigarette length, and air dilution for RJR products.

a

the relationship of the above-mentioned variables to mutagenicity.

Conclusions: Tar and air dilution were the best single predictors of mutagenicity on a
revertants/mg tar basis. Tar was the best single predictor for mutagenicity on a
revertantslcigarette basis, followed by weight of tobacco burned. Various combinations of
weight, length, tar and air dilution predicted mutagenicity better than any variable by itself.
However, variables other than these influence mutagenicity since the percent of variability

explained ranged from only 48% to 82%.
