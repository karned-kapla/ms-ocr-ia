Sum ry: Specificity of 1,2-diacylylycerol for the activation of protein kinase C sa investigated with various synthetic products. aroy. arachidaylglyearol. a major species of diacylglycerol derived from thn receptor-mediated hydrolymis of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerol: having naturally occurring fatty acids were almost equally sctive in this rola. Hormone-saniitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerol: during lipolyeis. The lack of : specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the staaroyl-arachidesy, spacies is the diacylglycerol wich which protein kinase C indeed cones in contact in the membrane when th receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglyoeroi: from other sources are produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into 5 phospholipid Te is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipid: produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2s -dependent cellular processes (1). However, the physiological pictare a well a the This investigation was supported in part by research grants froa the Scientific Research Fund of Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Japen (1986-1987), Muscular Dystrophy Association (1986-1987), Yanamouchi Foundation for Research on Metabolie Disorders (1986-1957).
