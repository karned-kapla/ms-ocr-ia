Alr is nontoxic and is necas 5 to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambars. can result In similar symptoms to those of exposure 01 oxygen. Inhalatlon of alr In high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
