Abstract-The extent o which current, Ã  and passive smoking are associatod with
other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was
studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 33
lifestyle factors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in
current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokers")
and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher
prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower
prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, docreased
with time of smoking oessation and was increased la passive smokers. The possible
magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated It is concluded that
confounding by multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies
where weak associations are observed. This applies particularly to studies investigating
the possible association of passive smoking with various health effocts.
