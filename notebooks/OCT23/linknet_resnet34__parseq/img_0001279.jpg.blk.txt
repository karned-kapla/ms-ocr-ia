Sumary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinasa C was investigated with various synthetic products. -Stearoyl-2-arachidonylglycerol, a major species of diacylglycerol derived from the receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active 4 this role. Hormone-sensitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stsaroyl-arachidonyl spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comas in contact in the nambrane when the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation to modulate many Ca2*-dependent cellular processes (1).
