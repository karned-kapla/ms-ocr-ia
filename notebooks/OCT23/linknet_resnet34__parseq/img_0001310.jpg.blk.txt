The 1984 survey included for the first time questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind sample of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians, As saoking varies systematic. ally by age, the general population MAS ageadjusted oa match the doctors' age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were snokers Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian vomen.
