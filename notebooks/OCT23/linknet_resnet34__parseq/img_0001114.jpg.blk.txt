Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may existin hyperbaric chambors, canresult In simllar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to highpressure environments of alr where the panial pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustica! distur. bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which alr is breathed 5 high-pressure anvironments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons) should be prepared to deal with Ilinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be recuired.
