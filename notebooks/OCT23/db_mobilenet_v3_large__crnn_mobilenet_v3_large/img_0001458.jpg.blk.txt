think there will be a desire by many i5 Congress to "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventuallv materializes, which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing ds a good example of a way e stay busy la DC Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can deive into and get better personal news coverage, while any action on our issues is likely a get buried, but you never
know!
