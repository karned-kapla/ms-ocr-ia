For many Americans. the future seems
about as secure as a dandellon puff.
An entire generation now reaching
middie age ia questioning whether they or
their children can do better than their
parents. Job security went out with three-
piece suits. and pundits have coined a new
term. dumpies for downwardly mobile
professionals. Today, both mother and
father work, not to be rich, but 10 send kids

looks more like an Andy Warhol canvas
than a Norman Rockwell portrait.
Statistically, Americans. both rich and
poor, are improving their lots. Their
buying power has doubled since the 1950s,
and their standard of living remains the
highest in the world. Others outside the
U.S. still belleve people can improve their

Warren Bennis, a business professor at
the University of Southern California, has
another explanation for this widespread
and Mahler-like melancholy. Recalling a

Everyone Seems Defeated"
When Mark Donnelly came of age in the
1960s, no problem seemed insoluble. In
1962, as a 20-year-old Army private. Mr.
Donnelly went to Oxford, Miss., 02 protect
James Meredith. whose enroilment at the
University of Mississippi sparked race
riots. For a week, Mr. Donnelly stood
outside Mr. Meredith's dormitory with a
rifle guarding him against attack. One
student spat on him. he recalls.
Mr. Donnelly also served in Vietnamf

would cure social ills has hit the wall of
reality in the form of intractable urban
poverty and a fury that erupted in Los
Angeles this spring. The proportion of
households with annual incomes under
$15.000 was lower in 1990, after adjustment
