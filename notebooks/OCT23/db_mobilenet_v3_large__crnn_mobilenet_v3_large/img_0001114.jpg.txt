Alr is nontoxle and is necas E to support Ife, Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambac can result In similar symptoms to those of exposure 01 oxygen. Inhalation of alr in high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-oressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen 11 in excess of two atmospheres may pro
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur-
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion. muscle twitching, and et pileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judoment lead o operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
