the rail-flick test. PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV 21(6) 937-941. 1984. - The naturally occurring brain peptide Tyr-
MIF-1 (yrfro-Lew-Gu-Nll was tested for its ability to block and reverse the actions of morphine de the tail-lick test.
Injected peripherally either 10 minutes before or after morphine, Tyr-MIF-1, like MIF-1, was found to significantly reduce
the antinociceptive actions of morphine on thermai pain. The results indicate that TVr-MIF-I may act, in part, as an

endogennus opinte antaponist.
