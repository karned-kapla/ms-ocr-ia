Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
existin hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure
emviromments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the panial pressure of orypen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur.
bances, abnormat sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twltching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confuslon and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facilities at which alr is breathed 5 high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons)
should be prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
