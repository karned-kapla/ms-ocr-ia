Summrry Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase C was investigated vith various synthetic products.
-staaroy1-2-arechidonylglycerol, a major species of diacylglycerol
derived from the receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho-
lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active 5 this
role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacyiglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidonyl
species is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase c indeed
comes in contact In the mambrane when the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dig-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
phospholipids produces diacyiglycerol for the activation
to modulate many Ca*--dependent cellular
processes (1). However, the physiological picture as vell as the
