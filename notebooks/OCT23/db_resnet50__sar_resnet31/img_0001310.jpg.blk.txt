The 1984 survey included for the first time questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients 911 of a stratifind sample of members of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed questionnaire, 435 ferale and 969 male physicians. AS snoking varies systraatic. ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted to match the doctors' age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

RESILTS: Seoking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were snokera. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian vonen. There seens to be A widening dub between the doctors and the lay population, because the difterences are more narked in the younger age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons want to quit snoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984a (urther considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts.

Smoking proportions : increasing in the female population, and reducing sharply anong female physicians. (Fig. 1) 251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are nov ex-saokers, fron this it Bay be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho continue snoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption per smoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for terale doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors and 41 of femle doctors who_smoke vere certain that they would snoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vosen think it likely or certain that they vill quit Amoking If their ovn predictions vere true, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 would be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
