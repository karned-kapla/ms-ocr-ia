Surmary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of

Daturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidonyl
spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the membrane vhen the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
of protein kinase C to modulate many ca2*-dependent cellular
processes (1). Hovever, the physiological pictare : vell as the
