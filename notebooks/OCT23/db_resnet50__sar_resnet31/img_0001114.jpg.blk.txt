Alr is nontoxlo and LE necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalatlon of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambors, canresult in similar symptoms o) those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalationofalrit high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alrwhere the partial pressure oforygen la in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of tingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur- bances, abnomal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscie twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be presant when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air la breathed 5 high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should s prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
