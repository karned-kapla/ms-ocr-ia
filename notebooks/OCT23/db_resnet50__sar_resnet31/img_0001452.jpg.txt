Karen-
anyway we can do it then???
Three topline thougts on my end:

See note below from Greg. We need of discuss before - get back 0 him and - know that tomorrow is tight but is there
1) Budget breakdown--I thought it would be more along the lines of $50-S65M but we'll need him to Justify.
2) Would like to discuss the whole RFP process as Ihave some concerns about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the
$$$ is primarily awarded from PM YSP--maybe our best bet is to give them the funds to award and theyhandle it
3) The timellne seems quito long--I thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound of ni there is stil
work that needs to be done --- is actually ok, but I'm not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting w/ the BOD
Let me know if you think wo can ozaonbs this in tomorrow or if our discussion needs lo take place on Monday, - can

soup to nuts so-to-speak. However, there are Issues if it's done that way as well,

(4/1-4/20) VS. a single presentation to the BOD.

have MM schedule
