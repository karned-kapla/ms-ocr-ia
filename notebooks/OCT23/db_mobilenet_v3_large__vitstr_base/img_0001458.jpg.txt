think there will be a desire by many 5 Congress to "stay relevant" to whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing is a good
example of a way 8 stay busy l DC Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
delve into and g√©t better personal news coverage, while any action on our issues is likely le get buried, but you never

know!
