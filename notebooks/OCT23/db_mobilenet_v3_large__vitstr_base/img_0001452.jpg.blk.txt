See note below from Greg. We need to discuss before get back le him and - know that tomorrow is tight but is there 1) Budget breakdown--I thought it would be more along the lines of $50-S65M but we'll need him to justify. 2) Woulld like to discuss the whole RFP process as have some concerns about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the $$$ is primarily awarded from PM eqfew-dSA our best bet is 9o give them the funds to award and they handle it 3) The timeline scems quito long-- thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound of a there is stil work that needs to be done ---hiich is actually ok, but I'm not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting wi the BOD Let me know if you think we can squoezo this in tomorrow or if our discussion needs lo take place on Monday, - - can
soup to nuts so-to-speak. However there are issues if it's done that way as well,
(4/1-4/20) vs. a single presentation to the BOD.
