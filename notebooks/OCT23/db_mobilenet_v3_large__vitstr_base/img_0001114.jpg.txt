Alr is nontoxlc and is necas 5 to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambars. can result In simllar symptoms to those of exposure o) oxygen. Inhalation of alr in high-pressure
enviromments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the parlal pressure of orypen i: in excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustica! distur
bances, abnormat sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon. muscle twitching, and e pileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead 9 operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
