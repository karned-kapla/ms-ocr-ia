For many Americans, the future seems
about as secure as a dandelion puff.
An entire generation now reaching
middie age ls questioning whether they or
their children can do better than their
parents. Job security went out with three-
piece suits. and pundits have coined a new
term, dumpies for downwardly mobile
professionals. Today, both mother and
father work, not to be rich, but l send kids

Statistically, Americans. both rich and
poor, are improving their lots. Their
buying power has doubled since the 1950s,
and their standard of living remains the
highest in the world. Others outside the
U.S. still believe people can improve their
lot in America: The current wave of immi-

Even so, many Americans despair
about the future. in part that's because, in

the University of Southern California, has

EEveryone Seems Defeated'
When Mark Donnelly came of age in the
1960s, no problem seemed insoluble. In
1962, as a 20-year-old Army private. Mr.
Donnelly went to Oxford, Miss.. 02 protect
James Meredith. whose enrollment at the
University of Mississippi sparked race
riots. For a week, Mr. Donnelly stood
outside Mr. Meredith's dormitory with a
rifle guarding him against attack. One
student spat on him. he recalls.
Mr. Donnelly also served in Vietnamt.

Today, his view is different The prob-
