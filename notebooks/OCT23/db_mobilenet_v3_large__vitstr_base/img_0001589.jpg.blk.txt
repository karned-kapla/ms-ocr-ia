Boston, Massachuserts 02115 A school and community based intervention to influence health behavior and cardiovas- cular disease (CVD) risk factors in 13- to 15-year-old children was carried out in North Karelia. Finland. The intervention was carried out on oml levels: (a) an intensive interven- tion (II) in two schools and (b) a county-wide intervention 6 in the rest of North Karelia. For the evaluation three matched pairs of schools were chosen: the oml two schools to represent the CI and rwo schools from a reference county (R). 851 children, their parents, and their teachers were studied at the outset in 1978 and after the intervention in 1980. During the program the proportion of boys reporting to smoke at least 1-2 times per month increased 12.6% in II, 8.2% in CI and 29.7% in the R schools (P v 0.001 between II and R) and in girls 9.0%, 18.0% and 20.0%, respectively, (P v 0.05 between = and R). The mean serum total cholesterol was 5.1 mmolliter in 1978 and a decreased among boys 0.5 mmoVliter in all three school groups. Among girls, the decrease was 0.43 mmolliter (II), 0.35 mmoViiter (CI), and 0.21 mmolliter (R) (P v 0.01 between II and R). The mean amount of fat from milk and butter changed among boys -8 g (II), 0 g (CI), and +3 g (R) and among girls -16g. -2g, and -5; ci respectively (both P A 0.01 between IT and R). The intervention had no effect on blood pressure although there was some reported reduction in the salt consump- tion in the intervention schools. A relative decrease according to the intervention level was * served among North Karelian chiddren in occurrence of psychosomatic symptoms. The effects were not related 9 increases in health knowledge or changes in attitudes and did not lead, on Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major, singular public health problem in most of the industrial world, but especially ia Finland (6, 11). A number of pro- spective studies have indicated that possibilities for CVD prevention lie in reduc- tion of well established risk factors: smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, and hypertension (6, 18, 22). Several preventive trials Suoue adults are under way to test the hypothesis that risk factor reduction in the population will lead to reduced mortality and morbidity from CVD (17, 25, 29). Data from the North Karelia project have indicated that an innovative community-based program can lead to a This work has been aided by grants from the Finnish National Board of Health and National
