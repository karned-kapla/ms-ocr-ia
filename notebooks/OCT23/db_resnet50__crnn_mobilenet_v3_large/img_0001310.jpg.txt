< 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions from
siailar surveys in 1952' and 1974. The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sanple of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed
questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians. As snoking varies systenatic
ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted to match the doctors' age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper say

therefore ditfer froa official Norwegian figures.

Seoking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere snokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were ssokera. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian wonen. There seens to be a widening dvb betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are nore marked in the younger
age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit snoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there was in 1984 further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in snoking buowe males is nuch sterper buosv doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Saoking proportions : increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply anong fesale physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of male and 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it Bay be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per saoker was 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for female doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors' con-
suaption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors who_smoke vere certain that they vould smoke in 1989,
vhereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vosen think it likely or certain that they
will quit nnoking. If their ovn predictions vere true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for female doctors.
