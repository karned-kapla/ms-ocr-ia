Alr ls nontoxle and is necassary to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult io similar symptoms 01 those of exposure to oxygen. inhalationofairint high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to highpressure environments of airwhere the pantial pressure oforygen in in excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of tingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur.
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judoment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
