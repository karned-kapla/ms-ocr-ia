Surary: Specificity of 1.2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products. "Tostodisthemgpsess-t-Dersais-I a major species of discylglycerol derived trom the receptor-medisted sTektorpiy of inositol phospho- lipids, : most active, but many other discylglycerols having naturaily occurring fatty acids vere almost aquaily active in this role. Bormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diseylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the posaibility that the stsarogl-arachisety) spacios is the discylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comas in contact in the membrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca?*-dependent cellular processes (1).
