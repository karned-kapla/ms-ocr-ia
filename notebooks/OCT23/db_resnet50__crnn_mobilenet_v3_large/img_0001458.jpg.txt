- think there will be a desire by many is Congress to "stay relevant 0 whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing le a good
example of la way 8. stay busy la DC. Ithink it le unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
deive into and get better personal news coverage. while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never

know!
