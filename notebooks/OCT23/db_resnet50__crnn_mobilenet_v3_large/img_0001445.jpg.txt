IN RECENT years, many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role
for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [I. 2]. In the Framingham Study.

social factors to CHD and also 01 cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive question of
temporal precedence and a priori self-selection still requires further clarification, however
In the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have
been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with
nonsmokers. is these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts
of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except
for the difference in smoking habit Very little evidence has been available. however. to
The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies ICHDS) of the
