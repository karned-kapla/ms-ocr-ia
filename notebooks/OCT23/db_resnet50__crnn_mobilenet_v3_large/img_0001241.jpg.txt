ABSTRACT TEXT:

A lightweight and disposable filter holder assembly used in the collection
of total particulate matter in cigarette smoke was developed as a
the currently used Lucite filter holder. Not only are these new holders
lighter in weight 15 grams versus 27 grams for the Lucite holder) but the
inconvenient and time-consuming steps of washing these holders in an alcohol
bath and drying prior to subsequent use are also eliminated.
During the development of these holders, it was noted that certain types
of materials, including Lucite, were very sensitive to changes in the moisture
content of the environment resulting in highly variable TPM results. These
variations become most significant for extremely low yield cigarettes where
negative TPM deliveries have been frequently encountered during the analysis.
A negative TPM result indicates a loss of weight of the filter assembly during
the smoking procedure. These negative numbers have been obtained even when
something was collected during the smoking process. Therefore, the
apparently negative TPM deliveries must be a result of an artifact in the smoke
particulate matter collection procedure. Experimental data are presented
showing that the observed artifact is primarily due to some phenomenon
at the surface of the filter holder during, but extraneous to, the particulate occurring
matter collection process. This phenomenon is shown to be attributable to
the inherent property of certain materials, including Lucite, to easily adsorb
In order to minimize the observed bias in the TPM results and thus allow
for the collection of more meaningful data, a lightweight and disposable holder
made out of polypropylene and polystyrene was developed. In addition to the
obvious advantages of being lightweight and disposable, experimental evidence
was presented showing that a negative bias which becomes significant at low
TPM delivery levels is eliminated through the use of these holders because
of their inherent insensitivity to moisture fluctuations in the environment.
