Dear Cesar:

There is enclosed a statement from our firm for
services that we provided to PMI Latin America during the
first calendar quarter of 1991. I also am enclosing an opening
statement, covering the first quarter of 1991, on the ETS
consultant project for Latin America. Please let me know, of
course, if you have questions about either statement.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,
John P. Rupp
