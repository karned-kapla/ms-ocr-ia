DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS ALISON THORNTON, PETER LEE* and JOIN FRY 'd N. 3 Statistics and Computing Lad, 17 Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Receied le reotsed form & March 1994) Abstrect- * extent to which current, ex- and passive smoking are associated with other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 33 lifestyle factors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, docreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased ie passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors :. estimated. It is concluded that confounding by multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where L asociations are obscrved. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
