Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalatlon of alr In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambors, canresult In similar symptom. to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr la high-pressure environmenta can also result la accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the parta pressure of orygen Is In excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur- bances, abnomal sensations, Impalred coordinatlon, confusion, muscle twltching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be presant when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air ls breathed In high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should be prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
