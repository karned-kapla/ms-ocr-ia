derived from the receptor-mediated hydrolynis of inositol phospho-
lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerole during lipolysis. The lack of à speciticity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidory
spacies is the diacylglycerol vith which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the mambrane when the receptor in stimulated,
and that diacylglycerole from other sources are produced in dig-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into à phospholipid
It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2, -dependent cellular
processes (1). Hovever, the physiological pictare as vell as the
