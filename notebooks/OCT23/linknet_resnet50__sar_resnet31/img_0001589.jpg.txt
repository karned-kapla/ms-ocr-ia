A school and community based intervention to influence health behavior and cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) risk factors in 13- to 15-year-old children was carried out in North
Karelia, Finland. The intervention was carried out on two levels: (a) an intensive interven-
tion (II) in two schools and (b) a county-wide intervention (CI) in the rest of North Karelia.
wo schools to represent the CI and two schools from a reference county (R). 851 children,
their parents, and their teachers were studied at the outset in 1978 and after the intervention
in 1980. During the program the proportion of boys reporting to smoke at least 1-2 times per
month increased 12.6% in IL. 8.2% in CI and 29.7% in the R schools (P A 0.001 between II
and RI and in giris 9.0%, 18.0% and 20.0%, respectively, S V 0.05 between II and R). The
mean serum total cholesterol was 5.1 mmolliter in 1978 and it decreased among boys 0.5
mmolliter in all three school groups. Among girls. the decrease was 0.43 mmolliter (II), 0.35
mmolliter (CI), and 0.21 mmolliter (R) (P < 0.01 between II and R). The mean amount of fat

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major, singular public health problem in

spective studies have indicated that possibilities for CVD prevention lie in reduc-
tion of well established risk factors: smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, and
hypertension (6, 18, 22). Several preventive trials among adults are under way to
test the hypothesis that risk factor reduction in the population will lead to reduced
mortality and morbidity from CVD (17, 25, 29). Data from the North Karelia
bave indicated that an innovative community-based program can lead to a
