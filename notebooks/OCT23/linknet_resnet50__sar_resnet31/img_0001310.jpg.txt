BESILTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whercas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were snokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors saoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vonen. There seens to be A widening des betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences : more narked in the younger
age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a (urther considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of prersons 65 ynars of age
and older. Thr decrease in smoking buowe males is much stceper buose doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply Buowe female physicians. (Fig. 11
251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are nov ex-saokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The : consueption
per snoker was 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for temle doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and 03 the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 yeArs, only 111 of nale doctors
and a of femle doctors who_smake vere certain that they would snoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they
vill quit Amoking. It their ovn predictions vere truc, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 would be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fenale doctors
