FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

James Snapp, insurance broker and former Mayor of
El Cajon, today urged his friends and neighbors to support
Californians for Common Sense in the organization's fight
against the smoking prohibitions proposition, Proposition 5,
"The burden on California taxpayers has reached the
limit,' Snapp said. "The people, through Proposition 13,

on the November ballot.

said they don't want this kind of spending.

"Now comes the smoking prohibitions proposition that
will be on our November ballot. It would cost an additional
$43 million in local and state tax money to pay for an enormous
system of expensive signs (at every entrance to every facility of
every state and local governmental entity), law cnforcement and

court costs.

"This additional tax load is not necessary. I am supporting
Californians for Common Sense to defeat this needless and costly

initiative.'

Co-chairmer of Californians for Common Sense, the organization
campaigning for defeat of Proposition 5, are Houston I. Flournoy,
dean of the University of Southern California Center for Public
Affairs, Katherine B. Dunlap, prominent conservationist and civic
leader and John F. Henning, executive secretary-treasurer of the

California Labor Federation (AFL-CIO).
