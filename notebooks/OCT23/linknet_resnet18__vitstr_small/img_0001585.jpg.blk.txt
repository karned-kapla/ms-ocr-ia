Dear Cesar:
There is enclosed a statement from our firm for services that we provided to PMI Latin America during the first calendar quarter of 1991. I also am enclosing an opening statement, covering the first quarter of 1991, on the ETS consultant project for Latin America. Please let me know, of course, if you have questions about either statement.
Best wishes.
Sincerely, S
John P. Rupp
