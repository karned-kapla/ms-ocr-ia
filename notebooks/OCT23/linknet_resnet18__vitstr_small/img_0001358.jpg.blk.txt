The purpose of this study SEA to establish a lung tumor studies have shown that both NNK and BaP readily produce model for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents against lung tumors in this strain (3-8). Lung adenomas are induced lung cancer In smokers. Lung tumor induction in AJ mice rapidly and can be readily quantified and their progression 01 by 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) carcinomas has been described (3-8). However. the combined and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was studied using protocols in effects of NNK and BaP have not been thoroughly investigated. individually or in combination. Groups of female A/J mice CI evaluate the effects of chemopreventive agents.

The mice were killed diethylnitrosamine and7.12-dimethylbenzdllattrracene (9,10). either 9 or 19 weeks later and tumors of the lung and We have used the AJ mouse OI evaluate the effects of forestomach were counted. The i- route of administration isothiocyanates against lung tumor induction by NNK proved to be more satisfactory than i.p. administration, (4,11,12). Results obtained with the A1I mouse can be replicated because it avoided complications due to tumor formation at in other model systems. For example, phenethyl isothiocyanate the Injection site and associated mortality A dose response (PEITC) is an effective inhibitor of lung tumorr induction by relationship for lung tumor induction by i.g. administration NNK in both the A/1 mouse and F344 rat (11,13). mice killed 9 or 19 weeks after completion of carcinogen the effects of single chemopreventive agents against single treatment.
