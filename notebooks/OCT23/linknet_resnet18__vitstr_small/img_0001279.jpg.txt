Sumaryy: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase vas investigated vith various synthetic products.
Stearoyl- -arschidonylglycerrl major species of diacylglycerol
derived from the recaptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho-
lipids was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specifici 2
be reconciled with the possibility that a stearoyl-arachi onv
spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the mambrane vhen the receptor is . timulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dis
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation

processes (1). However the physiological pictare as vell as the
