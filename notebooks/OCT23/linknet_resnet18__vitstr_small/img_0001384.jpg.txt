Dear Dr. fishean:
and Salk.

We are looking fonard to your active participation in the scientific activities
of the La Jolia rescarch cocdunity In particular, the activities of the La Jolla
Cancer Resezrch Founration and your studies on alkaline pnosphatase isoenzymes
should fit in well with ongoing activities not only at UCSD but also at Scripps
The establisnrent of a focal center for rcsearch proorams on oncodevelopmental
prublems is particularly irely. It will be o: o:at potential importance for
pulling tcgetter work, by a number of laboratories directed toward isolation,
characteriztaion and doterrination of the sioniticance of huran oncodevelcpmenta
antigens such as alphafeteprotein and carcinorsbryonic anticens.
One of the goals of the work in our laboratorv is to determine the relationship
of increased serua concentrations of AFP to prenalignant lesions or carcinogen
