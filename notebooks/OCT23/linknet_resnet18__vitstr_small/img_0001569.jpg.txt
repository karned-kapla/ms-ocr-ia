The presence of different monooxygenase activities has been docu-
mented in buman placental microsomes. The predominating cytochrome P.
450, that of androgen aromatase, catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens (1).
Aromatase P-450 bas been tbe object of numerous studies to determine its
mechanism of action and to purify it (2, 3). Gough et a [4) repored the
presence of another enzyme system which catalyzes the hydroxylation of
xenobiotic substances. It bas also been reported that a placental cytochrome
P-450 is responsible for the hydroxylation of benzo(a)pyrene via aryl hydro-
carbon hydroxylase (S-7). The low content of the responding cytochrome P.
450 in human placenta and instability during purification have made it
dificuut to isolate any other active P-450 enzyme. As a side beneft gained
from our procedure to purify and characterize catalytically active aromatase
P-450 (3), we found a fraction from the immunoafiinity chromatography
which showed a high level of xenobiotic activity with little contaminating
aromausee activity. Through the use ofconventional puriticttion procedures.
we obuaieed a xenobiotically active P-450 with no aromatase activity.
Previous studies on aryl hydrocarbon bydroxylase activity have demon-
strated higher levels of this activity in smokers but not in nonsmokers (8, 9).
