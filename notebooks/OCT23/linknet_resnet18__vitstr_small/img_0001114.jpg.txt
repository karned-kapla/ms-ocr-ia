Alr is nontoxlc and is necassary to support Iife, Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such a3 pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr In high-pressure
environment: S also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of air where the panial pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acousticat distur.
bances, a bnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confuslon and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facilities at which air is breathed 5 high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and caissons)
should be prepared to deal with llnessess resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be recuired.
