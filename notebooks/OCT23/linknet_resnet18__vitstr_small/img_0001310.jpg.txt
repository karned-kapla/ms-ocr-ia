1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions fron
sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974? The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed
questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians, As snoking varies systrmatic
ally b age, the general population vas ageadjusted to match the doctors' 4ge
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.

RESULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were snokers Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to
411 of all Norwegian vonen. There seens to be widening gap betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are mare marked in the younger
age groups, and berause nore doctorss than lay persons vant to quit snoking.
In conparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors uho snoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in smoking among males is much stcrper buone doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Snoking proportions are increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply buone fenale physicians. (Fig. 11
251 of male and 151 of femal doctors are DOM ex-ssokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2. 400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per snoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is almost ident ical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984,
Vhen asked to predict their snoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors who snoke vere certain that they would snoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they
vill quit smoking. If their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of
buTYons in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
A new feature of the 1984 survey vas the inclusion of questions on doctors
