think there will be a desire by many in Congress 0 "stay relevant" to whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler, and a hearing is a good
example of a way to stay busy in DC Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
deive into and g√©t better personal news coverage while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never

know!
