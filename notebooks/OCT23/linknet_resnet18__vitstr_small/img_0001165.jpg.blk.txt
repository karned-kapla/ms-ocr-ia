A freg fell irte a wel 322 feet deep. Each day be I two feet up the side wall and sid one back I foet eack night How -ay days did I take thetreg to I out ofthe well? -rsD. Girolamo, South Ordige, I'm aware that my answer is going to drive everyone crary, but I'm going torisk i anyway: It will take him 30 days. To explain, let's suppose thas the well is oaly 2 foet doep. How many days will it take him te jump out? Less than one, because he can land = the botiom, then jump up to the edge and climb right out without sliding back et all. If the well is 3 foet deep, bowever, he'll jump up 2 foet R slide down onc during the first 24-bour period, then jump out : when the next day arrives, with only one full day behind him. if the well is4 foct deep, kr take him two days, and so Do. the number of days alwiys being two less than the feet. - I we'e - r 1 * lypocrittes M not, wly de 1 i : E fono isa't everyth lng I k i momey : & thit soems te cencern today's seciety? 7 Sievens, Yourgstown, Ohlo Ithink poople wbo don'thave money say i bocause tbey bope it's true, and people wbo do have money say irbecause they know it's true.
