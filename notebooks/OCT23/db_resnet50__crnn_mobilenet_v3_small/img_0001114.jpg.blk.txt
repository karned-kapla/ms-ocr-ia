Alr is nontoxlo and le necessary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In hlgh-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult in similar symptoms 01 those of exposure to oxygen. inhaiationofairint high-pressure envdronmenta can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to highpressure environments of airwhere the partiat pressure oforygen ie in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of tingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur- bances, abnormat sensations, Impaired coordination, confuslon, muscle twltching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be presant when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air la breathed 5 high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should 8 prepared to deal with llinesses resutting from decompreasion. Decompression equipment may be required.
