4 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vaS used to update earlier conclusions fton
sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974. The 1984 survey included for the first tin
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed
questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians. As snoking varies systematic-
ally by age, the general population v45 ageadjusted to satch the doctors" age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.

RECULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whereas in the Norwegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokera. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian wonen. There secas to be a widening dub betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are nore sarked in the younger
agc groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons want to quit saoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there was in 19844 further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in snoking Buowe nales is nuch stceper buonv doctors
than in the Norwegian sale population. Saoking proportions : increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply among female physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of sale and 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho
continue snoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per snoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984,
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of sale doctors
and 41 of female doctors whoanoke were certain that they would ssoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the sosen think it likely or certain that they
will quit smoking. If their own predictions were true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
