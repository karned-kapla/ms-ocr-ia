- think there will be a desire by many in Congress o "stay relevant la whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing le a good
example of la way 8. stay busy l5 DC. Ithink it le unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
deive into and get better personal news coverage while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never

know!
