Intracellular signal transduction pathways have central roles ia processes
such as growth, differentiation, neurotransmission and development. The
aberrant expression of components of various signal transduction pathways
has profound consequences for cellular functions. Recent findings indicate
that many cases of neoplasia and inherited diseases have, at their roots,
mutations in key steps of signalling pathways.
