Estimating Genetic Parameters of Survival Distributions: A Multifactorial Model

Department of Human Genetics, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond For a number of genetically influenced illnesses, age of onset is correlated between relatives. ia some cases, age of onset also serves : an index of an individual's inherited liabiliry to an illness. Typically, survival models for age of onset distri- butions do not allow for these effecte. We have used the gamma distribution as the basis of a model which specifies genetie variabiliry in a8e of onset. Specifically, we allow the hazard frequency parameter of che gamma distribution lo be a monotonic function of an individual's inherited liabiliry e an illness. under various gamma models indicate that age of onset correlations may be strikingly different from correlations in liabiliry, Maximum likelihood estimation procedures were used o obtain parameter estimates from simulated data sets and 01 determine whether le le possible o discriminate hetween gamma processes of different order. The results for 1,000 pairs of twins 00S) monotygotic and 500 dizygotic) gave parameter estimates that were fairly accurate but that decreased in precision as the order of the gamma process increased. We discuts the effect chis may have on inferences made about age of onset. Key words: age of onset correlations. survival models, gamma distribution

INTRODUCTION
Genetic analyses of illnesses and behaviors showing a variable age of onset require a knowledge of the cumulative probability of onset by given ages. Some approach√®s [Weinberg, 1915; Stromgren, 1938; Risch, 1983) derive this probability from prior age of onset distributions. Ouhers (Elston, 1973; Heimbuch et al., 1980; Risch, 1983] estimate parameters of a cumulative age of onset distribution from the data. When the data allow its use, the latter method ie more appealing since specific
