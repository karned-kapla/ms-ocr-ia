Summary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglyeerol for the activation of
protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products.
"ienoietdemprgmsss-1-plerseie- a major species of discylglycerol
derived trom the receptor-madiated sTuitospig of inositol phospho-
lipids, : most active, but many other discylgiycerols having
naturaily occurring fatty acids vare almost aquaily active in this
role. normone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
discylgiycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the steerepl-araohiactyl
spacies is the discylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the membrane vhen the receptor is stimulated,
and that diaoylglycerais from other sources : produced in dis-
tinct compartsents and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
of protein kinase c to modulata many Ca?*-dependent cellular
processes (1). However, the physiological pictare : vell as the
