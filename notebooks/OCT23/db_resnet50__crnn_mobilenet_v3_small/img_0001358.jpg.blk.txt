The purpose of this study SEM to establish a lung tumor studies have shown that both NNK and BaP readily produce model for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents against lung tumors in this strain (3-8). Lung adenomas are induced lung cancer in smokers. Lung tumor induction in AJ mice rapidly and can be readily quantified and their progression to by Lomc@yloymsmkorl0yidb-tb-oem (NNK) carcinomas has been described (3-8). However, the combineÃ© and benzofalpyrene (BaP) was studied using protocols in effects of NNK and BaP have not been thoroughly investigated. individually or in comhination. Groups of (emale A/J mice 2 evaluate the effects of chemopreventive agents.

The mice were killed diethyleitrosamine and7.12-imethylhenziolanthracene (9,10). either 9 or 61 weeks later and tumors of the lung and We have used the A/J mouse o1 evaluate the effects of forestomach were counted. The ig. route of administration isothiocyanates against lung tumor induction by NNK proved to be more satisfactory than "d'1 administration, (4.11.12).
