cle progression. This highly metastatic tumor
accounts for 25-30% of all lung cancers and
causes >25 000 deaths annually in the United
States (Birrer and Minna, 1989). SCLC cells ex-
press receptors for several autocrine growth
factors, including gastrin-releasing peptide
(Cuttitta et al., 1985; Carney et al, 1987), insulin-
like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (Macauly et al.,
Nakanishi et al., 1988b), and a transferrin-like
molecule (Nakanishi et al., 1988a; Vostrejs et

In addition to receptors for peptide growth
factors, some SCLC cell lines express musca-
rinic (Sorenson et al, 1983; Cunningham et al.,
1985; Williams and Lennon, 1990a) and nicotinic

affect SCLC proliferation (Williams and Lennon,
1990a). We report here that mACHR activation
inhibits DNA synthesis induced by serum, bom-
besin, insulin, or IGF-I in SCLC cells. MAChR

Introduction

in normal cells, the transition from proliferation
01 terminal differentiation is marked by with-
drawal from the cell cycle and an inability to
reenter the cycle in response to growth factors.
Transformed cells do not undergo this transi-
tion, but constitutively remain in the cell cycle;
