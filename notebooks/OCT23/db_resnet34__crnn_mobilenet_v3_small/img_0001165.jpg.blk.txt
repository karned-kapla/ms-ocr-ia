How many days will R take him e jump out? Less than one, because be can land at the bottom, then jump dn 0 the edge and climb right out without sliding back at all. If Tthe well is 3 foet doep, bowever, he'll jump Pup2 foet and slide down one during the fint 24-bour period, then jump out wheo the next day arrives, with only one full day behind him. If the well is4 foet deep, i take him two days, and O8 00.. .the number rofdays alwiys being two less than the fect.
