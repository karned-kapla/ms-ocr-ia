The 1 route of administration isothiocyanates against lung tumor induction by NNK proved to be more satisfactory than i.p. administration (4.11.12). Results obtained with the A/J mouse can be replicated because it avoided complications due to tumor formation at in other model systems For example, phenethyl isothiocyanate theinjection site and associated mortality.
