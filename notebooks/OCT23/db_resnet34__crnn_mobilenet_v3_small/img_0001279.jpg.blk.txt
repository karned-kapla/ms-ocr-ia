Surary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products. i-Staropi-2-arsehidonpigiyerol. a major species of diacylglycerol derived trom % receptor-Dediated sTuitospig of inositol phospho- lipids vas most active, but many other discylglycerole having naturaily occurring fatty acida vere almost aqually active in this role. Bormone-senzitive lipase could produce potentially active discyigiycerois during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the steregl'srscniaoy: species is the discylglycerol with which protein kinase c indeed comes in contact in the sembrane vben the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerois from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartaents and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hvdrolvsi: of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycero) for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca?* -dependent cellular processes (1).
