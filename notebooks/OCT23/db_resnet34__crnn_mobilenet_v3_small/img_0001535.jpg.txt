cle progression. This highly metastatic tumor
accounts for 25-30% of all lung cancers and
causes A 25 000 deaths annually in the United
States (Birrer and Minna, 1989). SCLC cells ex-
press receptors for several autocrine growth
factors, including gastrin-releasing peptide
(GRP, homologous to amphibian bombesin)
(Cuttitta et al., 1985; Carney et al., 1987), insulin-

In addition to receptors for peptide growth
factors, some SCLC cell lines express musca-
rinic (Sorenson et al., 1983; Cunningham et al.,
1985; Williams and Lennon, 1990a) and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (Maneckjee and Minna,
1990). The ability of acetylcholine receptors to

on our finding that activation of Ma muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) causes
drolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) and inhibits
voltage-gated Ca?* channel activity in SCLC
cells, we proposed that MAChR activation may
affect SCLC proliferation (Williams and Lennon,
1990a). We report here that mACHR activation
inhibits DNA svnthesis induced by serum, bom-
besin, insulin, or IGF-I in SCLC cells. MAChR
agonists arrest SCLC cells in both S and G,/M
phases of the cell cycle. mAChR activation ap-
