Air (s nontoxlo and is neces 5 to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambars can result In aimilar symptoms to those of exposure 01 oxygen. Inhalation of alr In high-pressure environmenta can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen iA in excess of two atmospheres may pro duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur- bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion. muscle twitching, and et pileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be presant when confusion and impaired Judgment lead oo operational errors.
