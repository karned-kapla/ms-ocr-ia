A 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions fton
siailar surveys in 1952' and 1974? The 1984 survey included for the first tim
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed
questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians As saoking varies systraatic
ally by age, the general population v45 ageadjusted 03 satch the doctors' 490
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fros official Norwegian figures.

RECULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere snokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokera. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors smoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vonen. There secas to be a widening gAp betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are sore narked in the younger
agc groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit saoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), wi th the exception of persons 65 years of age
and older. The decrease in snoking buowe nales is auch sterper buonv doctors
than in the Norwegian male population. Saoking proportions are increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply BUORe female physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of sale and 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it nay be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho
continue snoking have bot cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per snoker was 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 2 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
When asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of sale doctors
and 41 of female doctors who anoke were certain that they would ssoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the women think it likely or certain that they
vill quit snoking If their own predictions were true, the overall rates of
suoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
