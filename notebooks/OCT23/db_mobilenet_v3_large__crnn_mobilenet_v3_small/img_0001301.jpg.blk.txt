True-ra Ise Questions on the Chenistry and ye'sSoje/solevsfe, Odor end Flavor le H F Sone nocern workers suggest that accurate menaurement of vibrational frequency (in the far infrared, for example) of nn unknown odorant will permit prediction of its quallty and intenslty. No elenente substance, not even halldes or ozone hos any odor; Instead they react with the mucosa forning new products which are smelled; but - Sone odorants have sterlc or vibrational propertles which force the concluston that they are odor less whon they nre not. 11. TF Present evldence strongly suggests thet different ports of the olfactory receptor ares, Ilke the retina In the eye, are qubilty-specific T Odorents need not penetrate the mucous (liquid system) nor the receptor No one yet has a fire clue as to the criticol relation between the molecule and the receptor which pernits an odor perception. The greater the secretion rate of mucous or selive, the higher thelr pH, and both pll and tomperature Influence Ã  quality of sensation in the 111. - The Ideal Instrumentel detector : Id respond to odors in the sono quantitetive range as does an onimat or human subject.

Electrical stinulation of taste in man yields only reports of "sour" and a "metallic" or "alkaline" quality. Direct electrica stimuletion of the olfactory senso has nover yet beon successfully accompllshed. VIL. T Although total anosala Is rore In humans and egeusie even rarer, there Is evidence that in analogy to color vision deficiences, sone people are Insensitive to (only certein) Qualities while having normal sensitivity to others.
