think there will be a desire by many 5 Congress to "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing de a good
example of a way e stay busy lm DC Ithink it is unlikely. given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
