Abstract In many countries nicotine-containing chewing uns (Nicorette@) is used to help to break the habit of smoking. Saliva was collected every 5 min from chewers of nicotine chewing gum and analysed for tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Detectable levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines were found 5 all samples collected between 5 and 15 min after chewing had started. The levels of N-esitrosonornicoting ranged from 0.4 to 61 ng/g of saliva and thuse for the uns of N-nitrosoanatabine plus N'-nitrosoan- abasine from 1.3 to 46 ng/g. A(RandhyWadymesabe - -pyridy -butanone was not detected in the saliva. The nicotine chewing gum was found to contain dn to 380 ng tobacco-specific nitrosamines/g of
chewing gum.
