Photon Counting SPF A vory practical tool of great usable range le 200 to 650 nanometers for correcled value in those applications which are sensitivity-or excitation spectra, and 290 o 700 nanometers for cor-

signals too weak to measure by conventional tech- niques; has the greater stability nherent to pulse- height discrimination; and reduces noise by observing Chly photo cathode impulses which are averaged,
Ratio SPF The ratio photometer provides superior stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer to known spectral characleristica.partaty corrects for low intensity peak shift in far UV and increases the sig-
Corrected Spectra SPF A third generation corrected nal-to-noise ratio. The photometer operates in either spectra instrument which produces either quanta-cor- the conventional single beam mode or ratio mode and rected or energy-corrected excitation and emission has four time constants to provide optimum noise -dns spectra without the use of quantum counters.
