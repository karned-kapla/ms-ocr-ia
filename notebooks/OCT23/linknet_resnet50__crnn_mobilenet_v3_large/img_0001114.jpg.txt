Alr is nontoxle and is necassary to support Ilfe. inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxypen. Inhalation of alr in high-pressure
environmenta can also result in accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result in decompression sickness.
Exposure to highpressure environments of alr where the partia pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur-
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judoment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facilitias at which air is breathed in high-oressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwate diving. and calssons)
should be prepared to deal with Ilinestes resutting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be recuired.
