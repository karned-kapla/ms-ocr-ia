1984 survey on Norvegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions ftom
siailar surveys in 1952' and 1974. The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
saaple of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the nailed
questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 sale physicians, As saoking varies systraatic
ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted 03 match the doctors' age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper ay

therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.

RESULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were snokeru. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vosen. There seens to be A widening dvb betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences - nore marked in the younger
age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit snoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sase persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in snoking buowe males is nuch sterper buoav doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Saoking proportions are increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply buowe fenale physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of nale and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it Bay be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consusption
per saoker was 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost identical to the doctors' con-
suaption in 1974 and 03 the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors whosmoke vere certain that they vould smoke in 1989,
vhereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vosen think it likely or certain that they
will quit aoking. IE their oun predictions vere true, the overall rates of
suoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and s1 for fenale doctors.
