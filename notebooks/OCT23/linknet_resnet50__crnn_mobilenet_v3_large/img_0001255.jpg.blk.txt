DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS, PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS ALISON THORNTON, PETER LEE* and JOIN FRY P. N. 3 Statistion and Computing Ltd, 17 Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Receied le reotued form & Marck 1994) Abstract The extent to which current, ex- and passive smoking are associated with other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults, The distribution of 11 lifestyle factors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with - smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significandly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many dsk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, docreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased is passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bas from confounding by the risk factors is estimated. It is concluded that confounding a multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak associations are observed. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
