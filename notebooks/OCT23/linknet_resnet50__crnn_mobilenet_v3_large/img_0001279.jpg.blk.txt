Sum ry: Specificity of 1.3-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C vas investicated with various synthatic products. aroy Terechidseylslycerol, a major species of diacylglycerol derived from tha receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other discylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this role. Rormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of à speciticity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stsaroyl-eracaidoty) spacies is the discylglycerel with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the membrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerois from other sources are produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into à phospholipid Ie is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2, -dependent cellular processes (1).
