Alr is nontoxlc and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxypen. Inhalation of. alr in high-pressure anvironments 9 also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the panial pressure of orypen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur. bances, a bnomaa sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confuslon and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to nigh-pressure environments Facilities at which alr is breathed 5 high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should be prepared to deal with linesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
