think there will be a desire by many in Congress de "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventually materializes,
which means to stay ln DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler, and a hearing is a good
example of a way to stay busy in DC. Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can
deive into and g√©t better personal news coverage while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never

know!
