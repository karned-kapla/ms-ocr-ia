We are looking fonard to your active participation in the scientific activities of the La Jolia rescirch cocmunity In particular, the activities of the La Jolla Cancer Resezrch Founration and your studies on alkaline pnosphatase isoenzynes should fit in well with ongoing activities not only at UCSD but also at Scripps The establisnment of a focal center for research proorams on oncodevelopmental prublems is particularly irely. It will be 0 0r-t potential importance for pulling tegetter work, by a number of laboratories directed toward isolation, characteriztaion and dotorninatiion of the sioniticance of huran oncodevelopmenta antigens such as alphafeteprotein and Carcinorsbryonic anticens. One of the noals of the work in our laboratorv is to deternine the relationship of increased serui concentrations of ArP to precalignant lesions or carcinogen exposure in hunans.
