Photon Counting SPF A very practical tool of great usable range .a 200 to 650 nanometers for corrected
value in those applications which are sensitivity-or excitation spectra, and 290 to 700 nanometers for cor-
niques; has the greater stability inherent to pulse- stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer
Corrected Spectra SPF A third generation corrected nal-to-noise ratio. The photometer operates in either
