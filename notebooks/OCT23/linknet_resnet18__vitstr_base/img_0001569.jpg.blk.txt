The presence of different monooxygenase activities has been docu- mented in human placental microsomes. The predominating cytochrome P. 450, that of androgen aromatase, catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens (1). Aromatase P-450 has been tbe object of numerous studies to determine its mechanism of action and to purify it (2, 3). Gough et a [4) reported the presence of another enryme system which catalyzes the hydroxylation of xenobiotic substances. It has also been reported that a placental cytochrome P-450 is responsible for the hydroxylation of benzola)pyrene via aryl hydro- carbon hydroxylase (5-7). The low content of the responding cytochrome P. 450 in human placenta and instability during purification have made it difiiull to isolate any other active P-450 enzyme. As a side beneft gained from our procedure to purify and characterize catalytically active aromatase P-450 (3), we found a fraction from the immunoaffinity chromatography which showed a high level of xenobiotic activity with little contaminating aromatase activity. Through the use ofconventional purificaiion procedures, we obtained a xenobiotically active P-450 with no aromatase activity. Previous studies on aryl hydrocarbon bydroxylase activity have demon- strated higher levels of this activity in smokers but not in nonsmokers (8, 9).
