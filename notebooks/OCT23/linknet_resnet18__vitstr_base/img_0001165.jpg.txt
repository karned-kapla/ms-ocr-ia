I'm aware that my answer is going to
drive everyone crary, but I'm going
torisk i anyway: It will take him 30
days. To explain, let's suppose that
the well la oaly 2 foet deep. How
many days will it take him a jump
out? Less than one, because he can
land e the bottom, then jump up to
the edge and climb right out without
sliding back ut all. If the well is 3
foet deep, bowever, hh'll jump up 2
foet R slide down onc during the
first 24-bour period, then jump out :
when the next day arrives, with only
one full day behind him. if the well
is4 foet deep, ke" take him two
days, and sso 00. the number of days
always being two less than the fect.
