1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vAs used to update earlier conclusions fron
siailar surveys in 1952' and 1974? The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed
questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians. As saoking varies systematic
ally by age, the general population vAs ageadjusted to match the doctors' 4ge
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper .ay

therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.

RECULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokera Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to
411 of all Morwegian vonen. There secas to be widening gap betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the difterences are mare marked in the younger
age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons vant to quit snoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 4 further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors whe saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 years of age
and older. The decrease in smoking anong nales is much stceper buonv doctors
than in the Norvegian nale population. Snoking proportions are increasing in
the fenale population, and reducing sharply buowe fenale physicians. (Fig. 11
251 of male and 151 of fenale doctors are DOM ex-smokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2. 400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumption
per smoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for female doctors. This difference is almost ident ical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors who smoke vere certain that they would snoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they
will quit snoking. IE their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of
buTyons in 1989 would be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
A new feature of the 1984 survey vas the inclusion of questions on doctors
