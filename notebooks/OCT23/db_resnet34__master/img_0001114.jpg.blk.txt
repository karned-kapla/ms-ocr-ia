Alr is nontoxlo and is necassary to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambars. canresult in similar symptoms to those of exposure 0) oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood whlch may result U) decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure enviroaments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen Is In excess of two atmospheres may pro duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur. bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twltching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air ls breathed in high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should 3 prepared to dea! with Ilinesses resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be required.
