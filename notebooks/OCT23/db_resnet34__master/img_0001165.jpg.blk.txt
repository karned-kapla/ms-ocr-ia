A freg fel irte a well32feet deep.Each day I jumped two feet a. the side i and sld back down one foet teach night. How Dum days did Ittake E freg to I ort ofthe well? InsD. Girolamo, South Ordinge,NJ. I'm aware that my answer is going to drive everyone crary, but I'm torisk itanyway: It will take SEROT him days. To explain, let's suppose that the well la oaly 2 foet deep. How many days will it take him e jump out? Less than one, because he can land at the bottom, then jump dn in the edge and climb right out without sliding back at all. If the well is 3 foet deep, bowever, he'll jump up2 foet and slide down one during the first 24-bour period, then jump out when the next day arrives, with only one full day behlnd him. if the well is4 foet deep, k'l take bim two days, and of 00... .the number ofdays always being two less than the feet.
