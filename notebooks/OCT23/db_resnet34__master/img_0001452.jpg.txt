Karen-
anyway we can do it then7???
Three topline thougts on my end:

See note below from Greg. We need to discuss before Iget back le him and know that tomorrow is tight but is there
1) Budget breakdown--I thought it would be more along the lines of $50-S65M but we'll need him to justify.
2) Would like to discuss the whole RFP process as have some concerns about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the
$$$ is primarily awarded from PM YSP--maybe our best bet is to give them the funds to award and theyhandle it
3) The timeline seems quito long--1 thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound of a there is still
work that needs to be done --which is actually ok, but I'm not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting wi the BOD
Let me know if you think we can ozoonbs this in tomorrow or if our discussion needs lo take place on Monday, can

soup to nuts so-to-speak. However. there are issues if it's done that way as well.

(4/1-4/20) VS. a single presentation to the BOD.

have MM schedule
