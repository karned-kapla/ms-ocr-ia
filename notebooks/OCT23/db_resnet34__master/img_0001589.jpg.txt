A school and community based intervention to influence health behavior and cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) risk factors in 13- to 15-year-old children was carried out in North
Karelia, Finland. The intervention was carried out on two levels: (a) an intensive interven-
tion (II) in two schools and (b) a county-wide intervention 6 in the rest of North Karelia.
For the evaluation three matched pairs of schools were chosen: the two schools of the II,

month increased 12.6% in II, 8.2% in CI and 29.7% in the R schools de v 0.001 between II

mean serum total cholesterol was 5.1 mmolliter in 1978 and it decreased among boys 0.5
mmoliter in all three school groups. Among giris, the decrease was 0.43 mmol/liter (II), 0.35
mmoliter (CI), and 0.21 mmolliter (R) (P < 0.01 between II and R). The mean amount of fat
from milk and butter changed among boys -8 g (II), 0 B (CI), and +3 60 (R) and among girls
-16g, -28. and -5 g. respectively (both P A 0.01 between II and R). The intervention had no
effect on blood pressure although there was some reported reduction la the salt consump-

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major, singular public health problem in
most of the industrial worid, but especially in Finland (6, 11). A number of -oud
spective studies have indicated that possibilities for CVD prevention lie in reduc-
tion of well established risk factors: smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, and
hypertension (6, 18, 22). Several preventive trials among adults are under way to
test the hypothesis that risk factor reduction in the population will lead to reduced
mortality and morbidity from CVD (17, 25, 29). Data from the North Karelia
project have indicated that an innovative community-based program can lead to a
