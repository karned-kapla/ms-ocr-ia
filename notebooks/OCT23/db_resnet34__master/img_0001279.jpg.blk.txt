Summary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase c was investigated with various synthetic products. 1-scearoyl-2-arachidonylglycerol. e major species of diacylglycerol derived from € receptor-mediated ETEKTOIDA4 of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having naturaily occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidoryl spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase c indeed comes in contact in the nembrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-sediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2+ -dependent cellular processes (1).
