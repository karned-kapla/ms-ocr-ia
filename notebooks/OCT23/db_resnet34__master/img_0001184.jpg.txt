of the National Cancer Ins stitute, the desirability

The proceedings will aim at providing the relatively
few active investigators in tobacco and health
research programs with an opportunity to discuss
freely current and future research programs with
the intent of reaching common objectives nore quickly.

ThvolvedP in tobacco and health research oriented towards
producing less harmful smoking products. The partici-
pan ts mus t be both willing and able to share with
other investigators what is being learned from their
current activities and openly discuss plans for future
research in the field. It is thought that by bringing
such a group of experts togei ther to review ongoing
studies and to plan future investigations jointly less
harmful tobacco products will be available sooner and
cos tly research projects will not be duplicated unneces-
sarily. The meetings would be held at yearly intervals
with the different organizations acting as host.
