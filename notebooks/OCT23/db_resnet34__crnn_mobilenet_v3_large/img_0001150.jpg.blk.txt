ABSTRACT
Although the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Pick's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are still unknown, it has been suggested that perturbations ut element metabolism may play a role. Even if not causative factors. these imbalances may prove to be markers that could aid in diagnosis. We have emploved a * quential neutron activation analysis (NAA) procedure to determine elemental concentrations in brain, hair, fingernails, blood, and cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients and age-matched controls. Samples are first irradiated with acelerator-produced 14-MeV neu- trons for determination of nitrogen and phosphorus, then with reac- tor thermal neutrons for the instrumental determination of 16-18 mi- nor and trace elements, and, finaily, reactor-irradiated again, followed by a rapid radiochemical separation procedure (RNAA) ie determine four additional elements Major advantages of NAA are: (1) its simultaneous multielement capability; (2) the relative treedom from reagent and laboratory contamination; (3) the absence of major matrix effects; and (4) an adequate sensitivity for most elements of in terest. Ranges of concentrations by INAA and RNAA in selected con- trol tissues and interelement correlations in control brain are pre sented 2 illustrate results obtained by the procedure. Longitudinal studies of tissues from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lat "Author to whom all correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed
