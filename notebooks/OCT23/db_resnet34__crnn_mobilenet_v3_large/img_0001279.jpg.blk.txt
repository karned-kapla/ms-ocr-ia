Sumary: Specificity of 1.3-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products. i-Staarey1-3-sraehidomyiglycsrol e major species of diacylglycerol derived trom ( receptor-medisted sTektorpiy of inositol phospho- lipids, vas most active, but many other discylglycerols having naturaily occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this role. Rormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active discylgiycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arechiany) species is the diacylglycerel with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the nembrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolvsis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycero) for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many ca?* -dependent cellular processes (1).
