DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS ALISON THORNTON, PETER LEE* and JOIN FRY P. N. 3 Statisties and Computing Ltd, Lm Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Recetbed le reotsed, form & March 1994) Abstract-The extent to which current, ex- and passive smoking are associated with other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 13 lifestyle factors gencrally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence le heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, docreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased in passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated It de concluded that confounding by multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak associations are observed. This applies particularly o1 studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
