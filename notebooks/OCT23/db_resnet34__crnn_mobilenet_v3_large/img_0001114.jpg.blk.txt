Alr is nontoxle and is necassary to support Ilfe. inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambac canresult in similar symptoms to those of exposure 01 oxygen. inhalation of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result UI decompression sickness. Exposure to high-oressure anvirooments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur- bances, abnormat sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion. muscie twitching. and epileptiform selzures Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judoment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure anvironments Facilities at which air is breathed In high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should 3 prepared to deal with llinestes resutting from decompression.
