National Council uo Seoking and Health, P.0. Box 8025 Dep., Oslo e Norway A 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors Vs used to update earlier conclusions ftom sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974. The 1984 survey included for the first tine questions regarding doctors intervention with patients 911 of a stratifind sanple of nesbers of the Norvegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians. As saoking varies systenatic ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted to match the doctors age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere ssokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were snokera Only 11.41 of fenale doctors ssoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian vonen. There seens to be a videnina gap betveen the doctors and the lay population, because the differences are sore marked in the younger age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit snoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts.

If their ovn predictions vere true, the overall rates of ssoking in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for female doctors A nev feature ot the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors
