In response to increased GPC promotion activity, Doral S ceiling has becn increased to $3.00 in 9 regions, cffective June 1. Attached is a copy of the memo from Chff to Andy detailing the changc. I'vc summarized it for our
purposes hclow.
In 9 regions, incrcase the Doral ceiling to $0.30/$3.00 in all outlets. These regions arc For all remaining regions, keep the cciling as is. That is $0.20/S2.00 in all outlets Makc this effective in the data for next Saturday S update. I understand it is not possible to rerun the back data lo make this effective for the first two wccks in June in The timing on this revision appcars to be opcn. Please keep thesc revised ceiling levels for Doral in place in the affected regions until further notice. Itis possible and even
