Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambars. canresult 5 similar symptoms to those of exposure 01 oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result u) decompression sickness. Exposuro to high-pressure environments of air where the paniaa pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur. bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscie twitching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to nigh-pressure environments Facilities at which air is breathed in high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should 8 prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be required.
