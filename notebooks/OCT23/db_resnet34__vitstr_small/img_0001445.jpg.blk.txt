Abstract- -Evidence of noncomparabilits of self-formed smoker and nonsmoker groups of adolescents from the Child Health and Development Studies of the University of Califomia. Berkeley. was found in a study of antecedent psychosocial characteristics (observed at age 101 before the adoption ofthe smoking habit. With possible confounding factors controlled, eventual smokers showed significantly greater prevalence than nonsmokers of Type A personality traits, extraversion. psychoticism. anger. and restless sleep Eventual smokers were lower in socio- economic status than nonsmokers. and also erhibited significantly lower mean scores for the Raven Progressive Matrices and Peabody Picture Vocabulary tests For each trait. the trends of the data were consistent S boys and giris Since many of these traits are shown oI E into adult tife where they are tben rdated to coronary heart disease. the role of self-sclestion requires further consideration in causal inferences about smoking and coronary heart discase
INTRODUCTION
INi RECENT years, many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [1.2). In the Framingham Study. univariate and multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho- social factors 01 CHD and also 01 cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive question of temporal precedence and a priori self-sclection still requires further clarification, however. in the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with nonsmokers. In these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has heen available. however. to The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) of the University of Califomia. Berkeley, provide an opportunity to check this assumption by examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS is a prospective investigation of children from birth to late adolescence At various stages of their development, the children were examined as to their biological, social. and In this report, we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics of a large cohort of boys and girls before some of them later began cigarette smoking as teenagers Reprint requests should be addressed to: Frank w.
