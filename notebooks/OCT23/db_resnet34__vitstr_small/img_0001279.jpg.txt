Sumaryy: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase C was investigated vith various synthetic products.
1-Stearoy1-2-arachidonylglyceroll e major species of diacylglycerol
derived trom € receptor-mediated sysktoxpkq of inositol phospho-
lipids, vas most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturaily occurring fatty acids vere almost equaily active in this
role. Hormone-sensitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stsaroyl-arachidonyl
spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the membrane vhen the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation

processes (1). However, the physiologica) picture as vell as the
