model for studying the dysregulation of cell cy- cle progression. This highly metastatic tumor accounts for 25-30% of all lung cancers and causes A 25 000 deaths annually in the United States (Birrer and Minna, 1989). SCLC cells ex- press receptors for several autocrine growth factors, including gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP, homologous to amphibian bombesin) (Cuttitta et al., 1985; Carney et al., 1987), insulin- Nakanishi et al., 1988b), and a transferrin-like molecule (Nakanishi et al., 1988a; Vostrejs et erates different intracellular second messen- gers, which must converge on a common point In addition to receptors for peptide growth factors, some SCLC cell lines express musca- rinic (Sorenson et al., 1983; Cunningham et al., 1985; Williams and Lennon, 1990a) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Maneckjee and Minna, 1990). The ability of acetylcholine receptors to recognized (Conklin et al., 1988; Ashkenazi et al., 1989; Maneckjee and Minna, 1990). Based on our finding that activation of M, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) causes drolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) and inhibits voltage-gated Ca? channel activity .n SCLC cells, we proposed that mACHR activation may affect SCLC proliferation (Williams and Lennon, 1990a). We report here that mAChR activation inhibits DNA svnthesis induced by serum, bom- besin, insulin, or IGF-I in SCLC cells. mACHR agonists arrest SCLC cells in both S and G,/M phases of the cell cycle. mACHR activation ap- pears to disrupt a common event induced by transduction by growth factor receptors mACHA activation decreases DNA synthesis Carbachol decreases *H-thymidine uptake by cells cultured in serum (Figure 1).

We now report that mACHR to arrest in S and G,/M phases of the cell cycle, concomitant with a decrease In DNA synthesis. Cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis resume when mACHR are down-regulated.

The finding that DNA synthesis le inhibited even when mACHR are activated after exposure of cells to growth factors indicates that signal transduction by growth factor re- ceptors ls not the mechanism of mAChR-mediated growth inhibition, Our data suggest that mAChR activation disrupts a common event that ie induced by different growth factors and is fundamental for In normal cells, the transition from proliferation to terminal differentiation .so marked by with- drawal from the cell cycle and an inability to reenter the cycle in response to growth factors. Transformed cells do not undergo this transi- tion, but constitutively remain in the cell cycle; rupted (Heldin and Westermark, 1984; Wein- stein, 1987; Kraus et al., 1988).
