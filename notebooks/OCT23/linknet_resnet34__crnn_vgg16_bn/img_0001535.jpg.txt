model for studying the dysregulation of cell cy-
cle progression. This highly metastatic tumor
accounts for 25-30% % all lung cancers and
causes >25 000 deaths annually in the United
States (Birrer and Minna, 1989). SCLC cells ex-
press receptors for several autocrine growth
factors, including gastrin-releasing peptide
(GRP, homologous to amphibian bombesin)
(Cuttitta et al., 1985; Carney et al., 1987), insulin-
like growth factor- (IGF-I)(Macauly et al., 1988;
Nakanishi et al., 1988b), and a transferrin-like
molecule (Nakanishi et al., 1988a; Vostrejs et
al., 1988). Activation of these receptors gen-
gers, which must converge on a common point
to induce SCLC proliferation.
In addition to receptors for
factors, some SCLC cell lines express musca-
1985; Williams and Lennon, 1990a) and nicotinio
acetylcholine receptors (Maneckjee and Minna,
1990). The ability of acetylcholine receptors to
regulate cell proliferation has recently been
al., 1989; Maneckjee and Minna, 1990). Based
on our finding that activation of M, muscarinic
a√ßetylcholine receptors (mAChR) causes hy-
drolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) and inhibits
voltage-gated 5 channel activity in SCLC
cells, we proposed that mAChR activation may
affect SCLC proliferation (Williams and Lennon,
1990a). We report here that mAChR activation
inhibits DNA synthesis induced by serum, bom-
besin, insulin, or IGF-I in SCLC cells. mAChR
agonists arrest SCLC cells in both S and G,/M
pears to disrupt a common event induced by
transduction by growth factor receptors.

We prevlously reported that activation of musca-
rinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) of M, subtype
causes hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and inhibits
voltage-gated 3 channel activity ln small cell lung
carcinoma (SCLC) cells. We now report that mAChR
activation couses exponentially growing SCLC cells
concomitant with a decrease in DNA synthesis. Cell
cycle progression and DNA synthesis resume when
down-regulated In serum-starved
SCLC celis, mAChR activation inhibits DNA synthe-

is inhibited even when mAChR are activated after
