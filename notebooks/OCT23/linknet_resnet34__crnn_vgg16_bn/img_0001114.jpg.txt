Alr Is nontoxic and is necessary to support Hfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
existin hyperbaric chambers, canresult In simllar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of al where the partial pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur.
bances, abnormal sensations, impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twltching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facillties at which air Is breathed 5 high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons)
should be prepared to dea! with llinesses resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be reguired.
