The role of cathepsin L in malignant transformation
Susan E. Kane and Michael M. Gottesman -
Procathepsin 7 is the major excted protein ef malignantly What is MEP? The first hint as to the idendification of transformed mouse fibroblasts and it is one of the major MEP came from studies in which MEP was shown to acid asteine proteases in mammalian celis.
