National Council uo Seoking and Health, P.0. Box 8025 Dep., Oslo - Norway A 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors Mas used 8 update earlier conclusions from sinilar surveys in 1952' and 19747 The 1984 survey included for the first tin questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients, 911 of a stratified sample of members of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 male physicians, As saoking varies systematic ally by age, the general population Mas ageadjusted o match the doctors' age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may In 1984, 18.61 of male doctors were smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were smokers Only 11.41 of female doctors saoked compared to 411 of all Norwegian vomen. There seeas to be a widening gap between the doctors E the lay population, because the differences are more marked in the younger age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit saoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there MAs in 1984 a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both withip and across age cohorts. (not the sase persons), with the exception of persons 65 ysars of age and older. The decrease in smoking buone sales is much steeper buose doctors than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in the fcaale population, and reducing sharply among female physicians. (Fig. = 251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-smokers, from this it may be inferred that ne 400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors wha continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumption per saoker was = cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fesale doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 yeArs, only 111 of sale doctors and 41 of female doctors whosmoke were certain that they would smoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 545 of the women think it likely or certain that they will quit smoking. IE their own predictions were true, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 vould be 115 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors. A new feature of the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors
therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.
