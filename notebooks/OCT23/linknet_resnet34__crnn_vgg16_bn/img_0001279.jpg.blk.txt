Surmary: Specificity of 1.2-diacylglyerol for the activation of protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products. staaroyl-2-arachidosylglycarol. a major species of diacylglycerol derived from the recaptor-hadiated hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids were almost equally active 5 this rola. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacyiglycerol: during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the staroyl-arachiaay spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the membrane when the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglyoeroi: from other sources are produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is generally accepted that receptor-sediated hydrolysis of phoapholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation to modulate many Ca2*-depandent cellular processes (1).
