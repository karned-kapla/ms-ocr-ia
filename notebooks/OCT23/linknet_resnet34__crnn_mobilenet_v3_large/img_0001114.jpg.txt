Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
existin hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-oressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur-
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twitching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judoment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facilities at which air is breathed i5 high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons)
should be prepared to deal with Ilinestes resutting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be recuired.

may also result In nitrogen narcosis
