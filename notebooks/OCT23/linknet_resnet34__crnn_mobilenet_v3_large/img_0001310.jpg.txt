A 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors vas used 8 update earlier conclusions ftom
siailar surveys in 1952' and 1974. The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sanple of nenbers of the Norvegian Medical Assosiation responded to the nailed
questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians, As saoking varies systenatic
ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted 03 match the doctors age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper say
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere snokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were snokers Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vosen. There seens to be a widening gap betveen the doctors
& the lay population, because the differences are nore marked in the younger
age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit saoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in snoking buowe males is nuch sterper buosv doctors
than in the Norvegian nale population. Saoking proportions are increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply anong fenale physicians. (Fig. =
251 of nale and 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it Bay be
inferred that re 400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors who
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per saoker was M cigarettes per day for sale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost identical to the doctors' con-
suaption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors whosmoke vere certain that they vould suoke in 1989,
vhereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they
will quit anoking. If their oun predictions vere true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
A new feature of the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors

therefore ditfer fron official Norwegian figures.
