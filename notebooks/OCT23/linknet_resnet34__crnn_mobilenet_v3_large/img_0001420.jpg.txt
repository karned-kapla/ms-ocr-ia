Dear' Dietrich:

-Dr. Spears sent me your letter concerning the removal
of nitrosamines by acetate filters. This sounds interesting
I wish I had thought of it. Anyway, we will be happy to
supply you with whatever cigarettes you may need for this work.
If I may, I would like to suggest comparison of the follow-
ing four samples. 1) 85mm, typical U.S. blend cigarettes with
25mm cellulose acetate filters. 2) 85mm, same blend with 10mm
acetate filter (we will replace other 15mm with a plastic tube).
3) 8 5mm same blend with 25mm filter and 25-308 air dilution.
4) 8 5mm same blend without filter (achieved by pulling filter
If significant differences are found in these samples, we
may then want to talk about further studies to explore this in
more detail. Please let me know if the above suggestion is
suitable or if you have some thing else in mind, and how many

plugs from number 1) above.

cigarettes you will need for the experiment.

Very truly yours,
F. J. Schultz
