DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS, PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS ALISON THORNTON, PETER 3 and JOHON FRY P. N. 3 Statistics and Computing Ltd, 41 Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Recetbed le reotsed form & March 1994) Abstract-The extent 03 which current, ex- and passive smoking are associated with other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 33 lifestyle factors gencrally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, decreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased in passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bas from confounding by the risk factors # estimated. It is concluded that confounding by multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak asociations are observed. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
