Sumary: Specificity of 1.3-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinasa C vas investigated with various synthetic products. -Staaro/1-2-arechidoerigiyeerol. a major species of diacylglycerol derived from the receptor-Pediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other discylgiycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active 5 this role. Bormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the spacificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stssroyl-arachiacny) spacies is the diacylglycerel vith which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the membrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerois from other sources are produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation to modulate many Ca?*-dependent cellular processes (1). However, the physiological pictare as vell as the This investigation was supported in part by research grants fron the Scientific Research Fund of Ministry of Education, Sciece and Culture, Japan (1986-1987) Muscular Dystrophy Association (1986-1987) Yanamouchi Foundation 5 taken in part from the dissertation that will be subaitted by * Go to Kobe University School of Medicine in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the 1 Present address: Department of Internal Medicine, First Division, Iobe Abbreviations used are: EGTA, ethylene glycol bis (B-aminoethy) ether)- N,N.KT K -tetraacetic acid; HPLC, high perfornance liquid chromatography; and
