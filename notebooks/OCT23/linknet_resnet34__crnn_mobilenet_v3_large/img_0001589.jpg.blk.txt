Finland. The intervention was carried out on Ewo levels: (a) an intensive interven- tion (II) in two schools and (b) a county-wide intervention (CI) in the rest of North Karelia. For the evaluation three matched pairs of schools were chosen: the two schools of the II, om schools to represent the CI and two schools from a reference county (R). 851 children, their parents, and their teachers were studied at the outset in 1978 and after the intervention de 1980. During the program the proportion of boys reporting to smoke at least T 2 times per month increased 12.6% in II. 8.2% in CI and 29.7% ia the R schools e A 0.001 between II and R) and in girls 9.0%, 18.096 and 20.0%. respectively, (P A 0.05 between II and RJ.

A relative decrease according to the intervention level was ob- served among North Karelian chidren in occurrence of psychosomatic symptoms. The effects were not related to increases in health knowledge or changes in attitudes and did not lead, on Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major, singular public health problem in most of the industrial worid, but especially in Finland (6, 11). A number of pro- spective studies have indicated that possibilities for CVD prevention lie in reduc- tion of well established risk factors: smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, and hypertension (6, 18, 22). Several preventive trials among adults are under way to test the hypothesis that risk factor reduction in the population will lead to reduced mortality and morbidity from CVD (17, 25, 29). Data from the North Karelia project have indicated that an innovative community-based program can lead to a This work has been aided by grants from the Finnish National Board of Health and National
