Abstract -Evidence of noncomparability of self-formed smoker and nonsmoker groups of
adolescents from the Child Health and Development Studies of the University of Califomia,
Berkeley. wa1 found in a study of antecedent psychosocial characteristics lobserved at age 101
before the adoption of the smoking habit. With possible confounding factors controlled. eventual
smokers showed significantly greater prevalence than nonsmokers of Type A personality traits,
eutraversion. psychoticism. anger. and nestless sleep Eventual smokers were lower in socio
economic status than nonsmokers. and also eshibited significantly lower mean scores for the
Raven Progressive Matrices and Peabody Picture Vocabulary tests For each trait, the trends of
the data were consistent in boys and girls Since many of these traits are shown o "track' into
adult life. where they are then related 2 coronary heart disease. the role of self-sclection requires
further consideration in causal inferences about smoking and coronary heart discase.

INTRODUCTION

IN RECENT years, many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role
for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [I. 2] In the Framingham Study,
univariate and multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho-
social factors to CHD and also to cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive question of
temporal precedence and a priori self-selection still requires further clarification, however.
In the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have
been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with
nonsmokers. is these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts
of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except
for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has been available. however. to
The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies ICHDS) of the
University of Califomia. Berkeley, provide an opportunity 01 check this assumption by
examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS
is a prospective investigation of children from birth to late adolescence. At various stages
of their development, the children were examined as 01 their biological, social. and
In this report, we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics o a large
cohort of boys and girls before some of them later began cigarette smoking as teenagers
