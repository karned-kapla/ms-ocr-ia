Abstract- -In many countries nicotine-containing chewing gum (Nicorette*) is used to help to break the habit of smoking. Saliva was collected every Smin from chewers of nicotine chewing gum and analysed for tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Detectable levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines were found in all samples collected between 5 and 15min after chewing had started. The levels of N-nitrosonornicotine ranged from 0.4 to 19ng/g of saliva and thuse for the uns of N'-nitrosoanatabine plus N'-nitrosoan- abasine from 1.3 to 46ng/g 4(C-emiyt-Y-altowmita) 1-0-pyouyb-i-butamone was not detected in the saliva. The nicotine chewing gum was found to contain dn to 380 ng tobacco-specific nitrosamines/g of
chewing gum.
