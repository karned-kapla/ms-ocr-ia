National Council on Seoking and Health, P.0. Rox 8025 Dep Oslo 1 Norway 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to undate carlier conclusions from sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974? The 1984 survey included for the first timr questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind saaple of members of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 415 fennle and 969 sale physicians, As saoking varies systematic ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted 03 match the doctors" age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may
therefore differ fron official Norwegian tigures.
BESULIS: Secking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors were smokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of female doctors saoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian vosen. There secas to be a widening due betveen the doctors and the lay population, because the differences : more sarked in the younger age groups, and berause more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 years of age and older. The decrease in smoking DUONP males is auch stceper buour doctors than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in the feaale population, and reducing sharply BUOER female physicians. (Fig. 1) 251 of nale and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The aean consumption per smoker was 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fenale doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and 03 the consumption of the general population in 1984. vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of aale doctors and 1 of fenale doctors whosmoke vere certain that they would smoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vomen think it likely or certain that they will quit amoking. If their oun predictions vere truc, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 would be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors. A : feature of the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors"
