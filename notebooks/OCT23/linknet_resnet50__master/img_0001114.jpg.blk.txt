Alr is nontoxlo and is necassary to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambors, canresult In simliar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr In high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen Is In excess of two atmosoneres may pro- duce - variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur. bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twliching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air ls breathed in high-pressure environmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwate diving. and calssons) should be prepared to dea! with Ilinesses resutting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be recuired.
