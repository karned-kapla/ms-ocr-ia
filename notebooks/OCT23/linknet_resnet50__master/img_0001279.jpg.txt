aroy -arachidonylglycerol, a major species of diacylglycerol
derived from tha receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho-
lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of : specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidoryl
spacios is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the nambrane when the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dig-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into Ã  phospholipid
It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2+ -dependent cellular
processes (1). However, the physiological pictare as vell as the
