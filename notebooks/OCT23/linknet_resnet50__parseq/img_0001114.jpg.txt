Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambors, canresult in similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalatlon of alr in high-pressure
environmenta can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to highpressure environments of alr where the panlat pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur.
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facilities at which alr is breathed in high-pressure anvironments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons)
should be prepared to deal with Ilinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be recuired.

may also result In nitrogan narcosis.
