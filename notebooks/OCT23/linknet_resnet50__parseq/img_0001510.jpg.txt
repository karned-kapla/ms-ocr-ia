ASBESTOS workers are unintentional victims of
industrial progress. They are at risk of pulmonary
fibrosis, pleural calcification, mesothellomas and lung

involving not only air but also
wine and beer.' Fibers have been found in the
lungs of people without industrial asbestos ex-
posure. Whatever the exact nature of asbestos or
ferruginous bodies may be, there is no doubt that

most chemical and physical means and can float
freely in the atmosphere for prolonged periods.
