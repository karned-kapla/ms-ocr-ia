Sum EY: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinasa C was investigated with various synthetic products.
aroy -arschidonylglycerol. a major species of diacylglycerol
derived from the recaptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho-
lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of : specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stgaroyl-arachidonyl
spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the nambrane when the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dis-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into 5 phospholipid
It is genarally acceptad that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2+ -dependent cellular
processes (1). Hovever, the physiological pictare as vell as the
