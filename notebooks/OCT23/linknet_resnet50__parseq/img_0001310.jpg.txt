1984 survey on Norvegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions from
sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
saaple of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed
questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 sale physicians, As saoking varies systematic
ally by age, the general population MAS ageadjusted oa match the doctors' age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ from official Norwegian figures.

RESULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors saoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vomen. There secas to be A widening dvb betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences : more marked in the younger
age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in smoking Buowe males is auch steeper buoar doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Saoking proportions are increasing in
the fcaale population, and reducing sharply BUOEE fenale physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors who
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumption
per saoker was 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and 03 the consumption of the general population in 1984.
When asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors whosmoke vere certain that they would smoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vomen think it likely or certain that they
vill quit smoking. If their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
A a feature ot the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors'
