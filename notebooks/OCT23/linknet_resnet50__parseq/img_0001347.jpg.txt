RE: Message from E. Hurwitz/J. Prince

Hi Mark, as per your request and Clare' s note here' s what we ve got:

We are currently working on an "ad microsite" as part of PM21 on the website. It deals specifically with the ads and
includes a main page with copy that essentially gives a statement of purpose. It was written using preapproved language
but is still in draft form as it requires final sign off from David Greenberg. I re-sent it to Dominic Asante this morning
The other pieces of copy on the ad microsite deal specifically with each ad the "story" behind each one. I am not
enclosing these as they don't seem to fit the description of what you are looking for, but please let me know if that' s
Last, there are materials in the PM21 external tool kit that might fit your description below (PM21 Talking Points, Q&A &
Message Points). I am told that you know of the existence of these as you approved them all so I'm not including them

purpese. dec

to confirm his approval as well. It is enclosed here:

something you d like to have.

but can certainly forward them if you do want to include them in what you forward to Jane Cooney.

Just let me know Thanks. Joan
