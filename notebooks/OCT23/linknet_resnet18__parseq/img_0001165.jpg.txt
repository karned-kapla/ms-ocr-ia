drisD. Girolamo, Souah Oringe,
I'm aware that my answer is going to
drive everyone crary, but I'm going
torisk it anyway: It will take him 30
days. To explain, let's suppose that
the well la oaly 2 foet deep. How
many days will it take him de jump
out? Less than one, because he can
land a the bottom, then jump up to
the edge and climb right out without
sliding back at all. If the well is 3
foet deep, bowever, he'll jump up 2
foct a slide down one during the
fint 24-bour period, then jump out :
when the next day arrives, with only
onc full day behind him. if the well
is4 foct deep, it'u take him two
days, and so on. the number of days
always being two less than the feet.
