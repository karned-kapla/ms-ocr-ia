1984 survey on Norvegian doctors VAS used to update earlier conclusions from
siailar surveys in 1952' and 1974? The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of aenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed
questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians, As saoking varies systematic
ally by age, the general population MAS ageadjusted to match the doctors' age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fron official Norvegian figures.

RESULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokers Only 11.41 of fenale doctors saoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vomen. There secas to be widening gap between the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are more marked in the younger
age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors whn saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in smoking among males is auch steeper buoar doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Saoking proportions are increasing in
the feaale population, and reducing sharply Buowe fenale physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of male and 151 of feaale doctors are DOW ex-smokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2. 400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors who
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumption
per saoker was 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alaost ident ical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors who smoke vere certain that they would smoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vomen think it likely or certain that they
vill quit smoking. If their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of
burxons in 1989 would be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
A new feature of the 1984 survey vas the inclusion of questions on doctors
