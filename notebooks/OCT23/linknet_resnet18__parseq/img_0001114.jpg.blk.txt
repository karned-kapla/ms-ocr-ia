Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambors, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of. alr In high-pressure anvironments C also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the panlat pressure of orygen is in excess of two atmosoneres may pro- duce a variety of cantral nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur. bances, a bnormat sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air is breathed 5 high-pressure environmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons; should be prepared to deal with linesses resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be recuired.
