Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support life. Inhalatlon of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may existin hyperbaric chambors, canresult In simliar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen Is In excess of two atmospheres may pro duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur. bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be presant when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facillties at which air ls breathed is high-pressure anvironments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons) should be prepared to dea! with Ilinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
