ABSTRACT

Although the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease,
Pick's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are still unknown, it
has been suggested that perturbations in element metabolism may
play a role. Even if not causative factors, these imbalances may prove
to be markers that could aid in diagnosis. We have emploved a f
quential neutron activation analysis (NAA) procedure to determine
elemental concentrations in brain, hair, fingernails, blood, and cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients and age-matched controls.
Samples are first irradiated with accelerator-produced 14-MeV neu-
trons for determination of nitrogen and phosphorus, then with reac-
tor thermal neutrons for the instrumental determination of 16-18 mi-
nor and trace elements, and, finaily, reactor-irradiated again,
followed by a rapid radiochemical separation procedure (RNAA) to
determine four additional elements Major advantages of NAA are:
(1) its simultaneous multiclement capability; (2) the relative freedom
from reagent and laboratory contamination; (3) the absence of major
matrix effects; and (4) an adequate sensitivity for most elements of in-
terest Ranges of concentrations by INAA and RNAA in selected con-
trol tissues and interelement correlations in control brain are pre-
sented to illustrate results obtained by the procedure. Longitudinal
studies of tissues from Alzheimer S disease (AD) and amyotrophic lat
