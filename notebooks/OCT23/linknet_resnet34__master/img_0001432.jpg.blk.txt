Photon Counting SPF - A vory practical tool of great usable range le 200 to 650 nanometers for corrected value in those applications which are sensitivity-or excitation spectra, and 290 to 700 nanometers for cor-
scatter-limited. This instrument detects fluorescence rected emission spectra.
signals too weak to measure by conventional tech- niques; has the greater stability inherent to pulse- height discrimination; and reduces noise by observing ohly photo cathode impulses which are averaged.
Ratio SPF - The ratio photometer provides superior stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer to known spectral characteristics, partlally corrects for low intonsity peak shift in far UV and increases the sig-
Corrected Spectra SPF I A third generation corrected nal-to-noise ratio. The photometer operates in either spectra instrument which produces either quanta-cor- the conventional single beam mode or ratio mode and rected or energy-corrected excitation and emission has four time constants to provide optimum noise -dns spectra without the use of quantum counters.
