Summary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase c was investigated with various synthetic products. -Staaroy1-2-arachidonylglycerol, a major species of diacylglycerol derived from the receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active 5 this role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidosyl spacios is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the nambrane when the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dig- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation to modulate many Ca2*-dependent cellular processes (1). However, the physiological picture as vell as the This investigation was supported in part by research grants fros the Scientific Research Fund of Ministry of Education, Science and Colture, Japan (1986-1987) Muscular Dystrophy Association (1986-1987) Yanamouchi Foundation 5 taken in part from the dissertation that will be subaitted by x Go to Kobe University School of Medicine in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the 1 Present address: Department of Internal Medicine, First Division, Kobe Abbreviations used are: EGTA, ethylene glycol bis (Baninoethyl ether)- N,N,KT K -tetraacetic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; and
