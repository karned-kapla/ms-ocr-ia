FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Jamcs Snapp, insurance broker and former Mayor of
El Cajon, today urged his friends and neighbors to support
Californians for Common Sense in the organization's fight
against the smoking prohibitions proposition, Proposition 5,
"The burden on California taxpayers has reached the
limit," Snapp said. "The people, through Proposition 13,

on the November ballot.

said they don't want this kind of spending.

"Now comes thc smoking prohibitions proposition that
will be on our November ballot. It would cost an additional

system of expensive signs (at every entrance to every facility of
every state and local governmental entity), law enforcement and

court costs.

"This additional tax load is not necessary. I am supporting
Californians for Common Sense to' defeat this needless and costly

initiative."
