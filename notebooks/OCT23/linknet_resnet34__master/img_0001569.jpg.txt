The presence of different monooxygenase activities has been docu-
mented in human placental microsomes. The predominating cytochrome P-
450, that of androgen aromatase, catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens (1).
Aromatase P-450 bas been tbe object of numerous studies to determine its
mechanism of action and to purify it (2, 3). Gough et al. [4) reported the
presence of another enzyme system which catalyzes the hydroxylation of
xenobiotic substances. It has also been reported that a placental cytochrome
P-450 is responsible for the hydroxylation of benzola)pyrene via aryl hydro-
carbon hydroxylase [5-7). The low content of the responding cytochrome P.
450 in human placenta and instability during purification have made it
dificul to isolate any other active P-450 enzyme. As a side benefit sained
from our procedure to purify and characterize catalytically active aromatase
P-450 [3), we found a fraction from the immunoaffinity chromatography
which showed a high level of xenobiotic activity with little contaminating
aromatase activity. Through the use of conventional purification procedures,
we obtained a xenobiotically active P-450 with no aromatase activity.
Previous studies on aryl hydrocarbon bydroxylase activity have demon-
strated higher levels ofthis activity in amokers but not in nonsmokers (8, 9).
