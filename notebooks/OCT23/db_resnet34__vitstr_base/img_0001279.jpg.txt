Sumarr: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase C was investigated vith various synthetic products.
i-Stearoyl-2-arachidonyiglycerol. 4 major species of diacylglycerol

lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stsaroyl-arachidonyl
spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comas in contact in the nembrane vhen the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is genarally acceptad that receptor-mediated hydrolvsis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycero) for the activation
of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2+ "-dependent cellular
processes (1). However, the physiological picture as vell as the
