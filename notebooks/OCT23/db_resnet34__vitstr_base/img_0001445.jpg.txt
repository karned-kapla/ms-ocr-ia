Abstract- -Evidence of noncomparabiliit of self-formed smoker and nonsmoker groups of
adolescents from the Child Health and Development Studies of ihe University of Califomia.
Berkeley. was found in a study of antecedent psychosocial characteristics lobserved at age 101
before the adoption ofthe smoking habit. With possible confounding factors controlled, eventual
smokers showed significantly greater prevalence than nonsmokers of Type A personality traits.
eutraveriion. psychoticism. anger. and restless sleep Eventual smokers were lower in socio
economic status than nonsmokers. and also eshibited significantly lower mean scores for the
Raven Progressive Matrices and Peabody Picture Vocabulary tests For each trait. the trends of
the data were consistent a boys and girls Since many of these traits are shown oi â‚¬ into
adult life: where they are then related to coronary hear discase. the role of self-sclection requires
further consideration in causal inferences about smoking and coronary hear discase.

INTRODUCTION

Iv RECENT years, many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role
for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [1.2). In the Framingham Study.
univariate and multivariate anulyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho-
social factors o) CHD and also o1 cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive question of
temporal precedence and a priori self-sclection still requires further clarification. however.
ln the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have
been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with
nonsmokers. In these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts
of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except
for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has heen available. however. to
The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) of the
University of Califomia. Berkeley, provide an opportunity to check this assumption by
examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS
is a prospective investigation of children from birth to late adolescence At various stages
of their development, the children were examined as to their biological, social. and
In this report. we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics of a large
cohort of boys and girls before some of them later began cigarette smoking as teenugers
