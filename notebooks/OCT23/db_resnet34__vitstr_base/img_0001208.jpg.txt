Alicia asked me to get this document together in Powerpoint and send it to you.

This is from her 1999 Basic Sweeps file.

This includes both budget implications and RNL Vis Plan for 1999. Please be aware that the non-
retail leaders account that are quoted may not be the latest numbers. Alicia could not get into the
ADS system to get the new numbers. These numbers are probably from December.

Thank You.
