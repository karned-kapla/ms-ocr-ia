Future Imperfect Voices of a Generation Fear for the Status OfAmerican Dream Despite Their Success, Many Feel Their Parents Had More Cause for Optimism Yet Outsiders Still Want In By CLARE ANSBERRY And THOMAS F. O'BOYLE Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL For many Americans, the future seems about as secure as a dandelion puff. An entire generation now reaching middle age is questioning whether they or their children can do better than their parents. Job security went out with three- piece suits. and pundits have coined a new term. dumpies for downwardly mobile professionals. Today, both mother and father work, not to be rich, but to send kids 6 college. The complicated family seene looks more like an Andy Warhol canvas than a Norman Rockwell portrait. Statistically, Americans, both rich and poor, are improving their lots. Their buying power has doubled since the 1950s, and their standard of living remains the highest in the world. Others outside the U.S. still believe people can improve their lot in America: The current wave of immi- grants is the largest since early this cen- Even so, many Americans despair about the future. In part that's because, in relative terms, America's S, standard of liv- ing isn t as far ahead of everyone else's as It once :SEM other countries are catching "dn Nor is the U.S. rate of growth as rapid as in once was. And even some affluent Americans have discovered. as their par- ents warned, that money doesn 't buy hap- piness. The same numbers one in three Americans told researchers at the Na- tional Opinion Research Center they were "very happy" in both 1957 and 1990. No amount of money ensures happiness, con- cludes David G. Myers in his book "The of Happiness" : rather, happiness is satisfaction with whatever one has, Warren Bennis, a business professor at the University of Southern California, has another explanation for this widespread and Mahler-like melancholy.

These themes have been resonating. explicitly and implicitly, in the presiden tial campaign. Both President Bush and Gov.

But not everyone is grim. Those who have come from the poorest backgrounds or encountered the greatest hardships seem 8 retain the most hope. "Everyone Seems Defeated" When Mark Donnelly came of age in the 1960s, no problem seemed insoluble. In 1962, as a 20-year-old Army private, Mr. Donnelly went to Oxford, Miss., 02 protect James Meredith. whose enrollment at the University of Mississippi sparked race riots. For a week, Mr. Donnelly stood outside Mr. Meredith's dormitory with a Tifle guarding him against attack. One student spat on him. he recalls. Mr. Donnelly also served in Vietnam But after his discharge. he marched on Washington 6 pro- test the war and be- came a regional or- ganizer for Vietnam Vets Against the War. While attend- ing Columbia Uni- versity, Mr. Don- nelly blocked police from entering a building after stu- dents had seized it. "We were a gen- eration that had hoped the world could be a better Mark Donnelly place,' . says Mr. Donnelly, now a 50-year- old vice president at Chemical Bank in New York City. "We naively thought that problems were solvable."

The assumption that prosperity would cure social ills has hit the wall of reality in the form of intractable urban poverty and a fury that erupted in Los Angeles this spring.
