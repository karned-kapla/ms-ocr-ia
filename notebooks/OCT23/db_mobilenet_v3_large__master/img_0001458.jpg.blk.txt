think there will be a desire by many is Congress to "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventually materializes, which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler," and a hearing is a good example of a way to stay busy in DC Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can deive into and g√©t better personal news coverage, while any action on our issues is likely 10 get buried, but you never
