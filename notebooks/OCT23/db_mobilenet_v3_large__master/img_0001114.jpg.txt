Alr is nontoxic and is necas: E to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambars. can result In simliar symptoms to those of exposure 0) oxygen. Inhalation of alr In high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood whlch may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen = In excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur-
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twitching, and et pileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead of operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
