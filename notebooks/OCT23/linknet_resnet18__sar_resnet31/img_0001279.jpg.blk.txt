Surmary: Specificity of 1.2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase var investigated vith various synthetic products. Staaroyl- -arachidonylglycerol. major species of diacylglycerol derived from the recaptor-mediated hydrolynis of inositol phospho- lipids was most active but many other diacylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerole during lipolysis. The lack of the specifici 2 be reconciled with the possibility that à stearoyl-arachi snv spacies is the diacylglycerol vith which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the mambrane vhen the receptor is . timulated, and that diacylglycerole from other sources are produced in dis tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many ca2*-dependent cellular processes (1).
