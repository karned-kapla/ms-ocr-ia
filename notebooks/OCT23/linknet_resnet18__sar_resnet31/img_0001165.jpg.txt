4HsD. Girolano, South Ordnge,
I'm aware that my answer ls going to
drive everyone crary, but I'm going
torisk i anyway: It will take him 30
days. To explain, let's suppose that
the well la oaly 2 foet doep. How
many days will it take him to jump
out? Less than one, because he can
land et the bottom, then jump up to
the edge and climb right out without
sliding back et all. If the well is 3
foet deep, bowever, he'll jump up 2
foet a slide down one during the
first 24-bour period, then jump out :
when the next day arrives, with only
one full day behind him. If the well
is4 foct deep, k'll take blm two
days, and so DO. the number of days
always beirg two less than the foet.
