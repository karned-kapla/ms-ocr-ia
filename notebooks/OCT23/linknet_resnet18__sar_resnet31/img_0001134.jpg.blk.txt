Intracellular signal transduction pathways have central roles in processes such as growth, differentiation, neurotransmission and development. The aberrant expression of components of various signal transduction pathways has profound consequences for cellular functions Recent findings indicate that many cases of neoplasia and inherited diseases have, at their roots, mutations in key steps of signalling pathways.
