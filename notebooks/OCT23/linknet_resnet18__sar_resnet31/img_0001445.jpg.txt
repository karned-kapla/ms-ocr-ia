IN RECENT years, many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role
for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [I. 2]. In the Framingham Study.
univariate and multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho-
social factors to CHD and also to cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive question of
temporal precedence and a priori self-selection still requires further clarification. however.
In the absence of controiled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have
been inferred from observational studies that compare persons who smoke with
nonsmokers. In these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts
of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except
for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has been available. however. to
The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) of the
University of Califomia. Berkeley. provide un opportunity to check this assumption by
examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS
is a prospective investigation of children from birth to late adolescence At snouea stages
of their development, the children were examined as to their biological, social. and
In this report. we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics of a large
