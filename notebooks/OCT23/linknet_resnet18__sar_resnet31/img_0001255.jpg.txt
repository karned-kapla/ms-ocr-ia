Abstract Ã  extent to which current, ex and passive smoking are associated with
other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was
studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults The distribution of 31
lifestyle factors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in
current smokers, ex-smokers, never amokers living with . smoker ("passive smokers")
and other never smokers. or the 33 rick factors 27 showed a significantly higher
prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only t showed a lower
prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, docreased
with time of smoking cessation and was increased in passive smokers. The possible
magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated, It is concluded that
confounding by multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies
where weak associations are obscrved. This applies particularly to studies investigating
the possible association of pasive smoking with various heakh effocts.
