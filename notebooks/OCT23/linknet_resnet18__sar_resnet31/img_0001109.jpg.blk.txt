In some cases, age of onset also serves as an index of an individual's inherited liabiliry to us illness. Typically, survival models for age of onset distri- butions do not allow for these effects. We have used the gamma distribution as the basis of a model which specifies genetic variability in age of onset. Specifically, we allow the hazard frequency parameter of the gamma distribution to be a monotonic function of an individual is inherited liability to an illness. Simulations under various pamma models indicate that age of onset correlations may be strikingly different from correlations in liability. Maximum likelihood estimation procedures were used to obtain parameter estimates from simulated data sets and on determine whether it il possible to discriminate between different order. The resulus for 1,000 pairs of twins (S00 monorygotic and 500 dirygotic) gave parameter estimates that were fairly accurate but that decreased in precision as the order of the pamma process increased. We discuss the effect chis may have on inferences made about age of onset. Key words: age of onset correlations. survival models, gamma distribution

INTRODUCTION
Genetic analyses of illnesses and behaviors showing a variable age of onset require 2 knowledge of the cumulative probability of onset given approachès (Weinberg. 1915; Stromgren, 1938; Risch, 1983) derive this probability from prior age of onset distributions. Others (Elston, 1973: Heimbuch et al., 1980; Risch, 1983) estimate parameters of a cumulative age of onset distribution from the data. When the data allow its use, the latter method is more appealing since specific
