Typically, survival models for age of onset distri- butions do not allour for these effects. We have used the gamma distribution as the basis of a model which specifies genetic variabiliry in age of onset. Specifically, we aliow the hazard frequency parameter of the gamma distribution to be a under various gamma models indicate that age of onset correlations may be strikingly different from correlations in liability. Maximum likelihood estimation procedures were used Uo obtain parameter estimates from simulated data sets and o1 determine whether it is possible to discriminate between gamma processes of different order. The resulus for 1,000 pairs of twins (500 monozygotic and 500 dizygotic) gave parameter estimates that were fairly accurate but that decreased in precision as the order of the gamma process increased.

INTRODUCTION
Genetic analyses of illnesses and behaviors showing a variable age of onset require a knowledge of the cumulative probability of onset by given ages. Some approach√®s [Weinberg. 1915; Stromgren, 1938; Risch, 1983) derive this probability from prior age of onset disuributions. Others [Elston, 1973; Heimbuch et al., 1980; Risch, 1983) estimate parameters of a cumulative age of onset distribution from the data. When the data allow its use, the Jatter method le more appealing since specific
