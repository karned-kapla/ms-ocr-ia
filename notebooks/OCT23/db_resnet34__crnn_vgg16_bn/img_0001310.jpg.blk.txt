National Council uo Seoking and Health, P.0. Box 8025 Dep.. Oslo : Norvay A 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors was used to update earlier conclusions from sisilar surveys in 1952' and 19747. The 1984 survey included for the first Lie questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients 911 of a stratifind sample of sesbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 male physicians, As ssoking varies systematic ally by age, the general population :s ageadjusted to match the doctors' ase distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors were ssokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were ssokers Only 11.41 of female doctors saoked compared tn 411 of all Norwegian wopen. There seeas to be & widening gap between the doctors and the lay population, because the ditterences are are marked in the younger age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there MAs in 1984 a further considerabl decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both withip and across age cohorts. (not the sase persons), with the exception of persons 65 ysars of age than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in the feaale population, and reducing sharply suose female physicians (Fig. 1) 251 of sale and 151 of feaale doctors are noM ex-ssokers, from this it may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors who continue smoking have not : down on their tobacco use * mean consumption per saoker was 14 cigarettes pet day for sale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fesale doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 yeArs, only 111 of sale doctors and 41 of female doctors whosmoke were certain that they would ssoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 545 of the women think it likely or certain that they will quit smoking. IE their oMn predictions were truc, the overall rates of ssoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors A new feature ot the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors
