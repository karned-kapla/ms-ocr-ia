See note below from Greg. We need to discuss before Iget back d8 him and know that tomorrow is tight but is there 1) Budget breakdown- thought it would be more along the lines of $50-565M but we'll need him to justify. 2) Would like to discuss the whole RFP process as have some concerns about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the $$$ a primarily awarded from PM YSP--maybe our best bet is to give them the funds to award and theyhandle a 3) The timeline seems quito long-I thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound of a there is stil work that needs to be done ---which is actually ok, but I'm not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting wi the BOD Let me know if you think wo can ozoonbs this in tomorrow or if our discussion needs to take place on Monday, can
soup to nuts so-to-speak. However. there are issues if it's done that way as well.
