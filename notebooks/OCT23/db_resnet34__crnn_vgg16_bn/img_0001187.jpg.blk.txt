PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV 21(6) 937-941. 1984.--The naturally occurring brain peptide Tyr- MIF-1 (yrPo-Le-Cly-NIL, was tested for its ability to block and reverse the actions of morphine  the tail-ick test. Injected peripherally either 0I minutes before or after morphine, Tyr-MIF-1, like MIF-1, was found to significantly reduce the antinociceptive actions af morphine on thermai pain. The results indicate that Tyr-MIF- may act, in part, as an
endogennus apinte antaponist.
