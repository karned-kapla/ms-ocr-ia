Photon Counting SPF A very practical tool of great usablo range is 200 to 650 nanometers for corrected value in those applications which are sensitivity-or excitation spectra, and 290 to 700 nanometers for cor- niques: has the greater stability inherent to pulse- stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer height discrimination; and reduces noise by observing to known spectral characteristics, partially corrects for Corrected Spectra SPF - A third generation corrected nal-to-noise ratio.
