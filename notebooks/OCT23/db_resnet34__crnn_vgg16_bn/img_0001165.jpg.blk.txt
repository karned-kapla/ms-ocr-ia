A freg fell ite a we32feet deep.Eack day 3 jumped two feet 8. the side 1 and sud back dow ome foet teack aigt. How Aen days did Itake : freg to I out ofthe well? MrD. Girolamo, Soith Ondige.NJ I'm aware that my answer is going to drive everyone cnazy, but I'm torisk itanyway: It will take RE him days. To explain, let's suppose that the well la oaly 2 foet doep. How many days will I take him de jump out? Less than ope, because he can land at the bottom, then jump dn d8 the edge and climb right out without sliding back at all. If the well is 3 foet deep, bowever, he'l jump up2 foct and slide down one during the finst 24-bour period, then jump out when the next day arriyes, with only one full day behind him. if the well is4 foct deep,  take him two days, and os 00... the number rofdays alwiys being two less than the fect.
