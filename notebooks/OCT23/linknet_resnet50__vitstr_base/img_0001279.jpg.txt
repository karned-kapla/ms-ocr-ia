Summ EY: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase C van investigated with various synthetic products.
aroy. -arechidonylglycerol, a major species of diacylglycerol
derived from the receptor-mediated hydrolyais of inositol phospho-
lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive 1ipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of Ã  specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stsacoyl-arachidocyl
species is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the mambrane when the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources are produced in dig-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into 5 phospholipid
It is genarally acceptad that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2+ -dependent cellular
processes (1). However, the physiological pictare aR vell as the
