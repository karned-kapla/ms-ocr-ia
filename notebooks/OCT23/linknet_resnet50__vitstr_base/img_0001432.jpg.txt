Photon Counting SPF A very practical tool of great usable range .a 200 to 650 nanometers for corrected
value in those applications which are sensitivity-or excitation spectra, and 290 to 700 nanometers for cor-

scatter-limited. This instrument detects fluorescence rected emission spectra.

signals too weak to measure by conventional tech-
niques; has the greater stability inherent to pulse-
height discrimination; and reduces noise by observing
ohly photo cathode impulses which are averaged,

Ratio SPF The ratio photometer provides superior
stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer
to known spectral characteristics, partially corrects for
low intensity peak shift in far UV and increases the sig-

Corrected Spectra SPF A third generation corrected nal-to-noise ratio. The photometer operates in either
