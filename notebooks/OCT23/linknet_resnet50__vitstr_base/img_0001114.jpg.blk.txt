Alr is nontoxle and is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr in high-pressure envioommnnts can also result ln accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the panial pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur. bances, abnormat sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confuslon and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to nigh-pressure environments Facilities at which alr is breathed in high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwate diving. and calssons) should be prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
