model for studying the dysregulation of cell cy-
cle progression. This highly metastatic tumor
accounts for 25-30% of all lung cancers and
causes >25 000 deaths annually in the United
States (Birrer and Minna, 1989). SCLC cells ex-
press receptors for several autocrine growth
factors, including gastrin-releasing peptide
(GRP, homologous to amphibian bombesin)
(Cuttitta et al., 1985; Carney et al, 1987), insulin-
like growth factor-l (IGF-I) (Macauly et al.,
Nakanishi et al., 1988b), and a transferrin-like
molecule (Nakanishi et al., 1988a; Vostrejs et
al., 1988). Activation of these receptors gen-
erates different intracellular second messen-
gers, which must converge on a common point
proliferation.
in addition to receptors for
factors, some SCLC cell lines express musca-
rinic (Sorenson et al., 1983; Cunningham et al.,
1985; Williams and Lennon, 1990a) and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (Maneckjee and Minna,
1990). The ability of acetylcholine receptors to
regulate cell proliferation has recently been
recognized (Conklin et al., 1988; Ashkenaz et

cells, we proposed that mACHR activation may
affect SCLC proliferation (Williams and Lennon,
1990a). We report here that mAChR activation
inhibits DNA synthesis induced by serum, bom-
besin, insulin, or IGF-I in SCLC cells. mACHR
agonists arrest SCLC cells in both S and G2/M
phases of the cell cycle. mACHR activation ap-
pears to disrupt a common event induced by
different growth factors, which follows signal
transduction by growth factor receptors.

Introduction

In normal cells, the transition from proliferation
to terminal differentiation is" marked by with-
drawal from the cell cycle and an inability to
reenter the cycle in response to growth factors.
Transformed cells do not undergo this transi-
tion, but constitutively remain in the cell cycle;
the regulation of cell cycle progression is dis-
rupted (Heldin and Westermark, 1984; Wein-
stein, 1987; Kraus et al., 1988). Small cell lung
carcinoma (SCLC)' provides a clinically relevant
