Estimating Genetic Parameters of Survival Distributions: A Multifactorial Model

Department of Human Genetics, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond For a number of genetically influenced illnesses, age of onset is correlated between relatives. in some cases, age of onser also serves as an index of an individual's inheritedi liabiliry o an illness. Typically, survival models for age of onset distri- butions do not allow for these effects. We have used the gamma distribution as the basis of - model which specifies genetic variabiliry in age of onset. Specifically, we aliow the hazard frequency parameter of the gamma distribution to x a monotonic function of an individual inherited liability to an illness. Simulations under various gamma models indicate that age of onset correlations may be strikingly different from correlations in liability. Maximum likelihood estimation procedures were used to obtain parameter estimates from simulated daua seus and to deiermine whether i is possible to discriminate between gamma processes of different order. The resulus for 1,000 pairs of twins (500 monozygotic and 500 dirygotic) gave parameler estimates that were fairly accurate but that decreased is precision as the order of the gamma process increased. We discuss the effect chis may have on inferences made about age of onset. Key words: age of onset correlations, survival models, gamma distribution
INTRODUCTION
Genetic analyses of illnesses and behaviors showing a variable age of onset require a knowledge of the cumulative probability of onset by given ages. Some approach√®s [Weinberg. 1915; Stromgren, 1938; Risch, 1983) derive this probability from prior age of onset distributions. Ouhers (Elston, 1973; Heimbuch et al., 1980; Risch, 1983) estimate parameters of a cumulative age of onset distribution from the data, When the data allow it use, the latter method is more appealing since Reccived for publication January 11, 1988; revision accepied April 22, 1988.
