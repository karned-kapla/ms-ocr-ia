The 1984 survey included for the first time questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind saaple of menbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 wale physicians, As saoking varies systeaatic ally by age, the general population v4s ageadjusted o3 match the doctors' 4ge distribution.

BESULTS: Sroking. Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of aale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors seoked compared to 411 of all Morwegian vonen. There secas to be A widening dvb betveen the doctors and the lay population, because the differences : more marked in the younger agc groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable decrease in he proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age and older. The decrease in smoking buowe nales is much stceper buonv doctors than in the Norvegian nale population. Snoking proportions are increasing in the female population, and reducing sharply Buowe female physicians. (Fig. 11 251 of male and 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-smokers, fron this it may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumptior per snoker was 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fenale doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and 03 the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors and 41 of fenale doctors who_smoke vere certain that they would snoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they will quit smoking. If their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 5u for fenale doctors. A 2 feature ot the 1984 survey was the inclusion of questions on doctors"
