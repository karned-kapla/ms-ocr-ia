Surmary: Specificity of 1.2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products.
-Stearoyl-3-arachidonylglycerol, a major species of diacylglycerol
derived from the receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho-
lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active 44 this
role. Hormone-sensitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerola during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the staaroyl-arachidonyl
spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the mambrane when the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerole from other sources are produced in dig-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
to modate many ca*-dependent cellular
processes (1). Hovever the physiological pictare as vell as the
