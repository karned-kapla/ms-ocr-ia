--H Girolano, South Ordnge, NJ
I'm aware that my answer is going to
drive everyone crary, but I'm
to risk la anyway: It will take him
days. To explain, let's suppose that
the well is oaly 2 foet deep. How
many days will it take him en jump
out? Less than one, because he can
land et the bottom, then jump dn 8
the edge and climb right out without
sliding back et all. If the well is 3
foet deep, bowever, he'll jump dn 2
foet and clide down onc during the
first 24-bour period, then jump out
when the next day arrives, with only
one full day behind him. if the well
is4 foet deep, II, take blm two
days, and so DO.. .the number of days
always being two less than the feet.
