Ithink there will be a desire by many in Congress to "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventually materializes, which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler." and a hearing is a good example of a way 8. stay busy in DC. Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can delve into and get better personal news coverage, while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never
know!
