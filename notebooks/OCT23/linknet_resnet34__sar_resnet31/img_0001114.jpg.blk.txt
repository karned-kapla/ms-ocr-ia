Alr is nontoxic and Is necassary to support Ilfe. Inhalatlon of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may existin hyperbaric chambors, canresult In simllar symptoms to those ofexposure to oxygen. Inhalatlon of alrin high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the partiat pressure of orygen Is In excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur- bances, abnomal sensations, Impalred coordinatlon, confusion, muscle twitching. and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facilities at which air ls breathed 5 high-pressure anvironments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving and calssons) should be prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
