The A5 protein is expressed in pre-B cells in association with VpreB and u-heavy chains, and is critical for
differentiation to the B cell stage. Pre-B cell-specific expression of the A5 and VpreB genes is regulated at the level
of transcription initiation. ln this report, we have identified several DNase l-hypersensitive sites 2.5- to 6.0-kb
downstream of the A5 gene, which are present in the pre-B cel! line 70Z/3, but not in the myeloma cell line J558L.
These sites, however, were shown to have no transcriptional enhancer activity as measured by transient trans-
fection. Enhancer activity was identified within a 361-bp fragment (-296 6 +65, where +1 is the major 5'
transcription initiation site) upstream of the mouse A5 gene. This activity is orientation and position independent,
and is also tissue and differentiation stage specific (active in pre-B but not B and T cells). Deletion constructs
indicate that three adjacent areas (-210 to -169, -153 to -64, and -64 9 -22) are all necessary for enhancer
activity. Pre-B cell-specific promoter activity was shown 8 reside within the -219 to +109 fragment. Basal
promoter activity resides within the -64 to +109 fragment, but is not tissue specific or stage specific. A negative
element within the -101 to -64 region is active in all lymphoid cell lines tested and therefore cannot by itself be
responsible for the tissue and stage specificity. The data indicate that the elements responsible for the enhancer
activity (-210 to -22) are part of the A5 gene promoter and likely confer the tissue and stage specificity via
positive elements within the -210 to -22 region. The Journal of Immunology, 1995, 155: 0000-0000.
