DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS ALISO THORNTON, PETER Les* and JOIN FRY 'd N. 3 Statistics and Computing Led, 17 Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Recemed a rectsed Jorm 8 March 1994) Abstract- 4 extent to which current, ex- and passive smoking are associated with other risk factors, and the polential for confounding arising from these associations, was studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 33 lifestyle (actors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, decreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased ls passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors ". estimated. It is concluded that confounding by multiple risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where A associations are obscrved. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effects. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
