National Council on Seoking and Health, P.O. Box 8025 Dep.. Oslo 1, Norway < 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions fron sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first time questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind sample of menbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians. As saoking varies systematic. ally by age, the general population vAs ageadjusted to match the doctors' age distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may
therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.
REGULTS: Sroking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norwegian popula tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors saoked compared to 411 of all Morwegian women. There secas to be A widening dvb betveen the doctors and the lay population, because the differences are more marked in the younger agc groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who smoke, both withip and across age cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age and older. The decrease in smoking buowe nales is much stceper buonv doctors than in the Norvegian nale population. Snoking proportions : increasing in the female population, and reducing sharply anong fenale physicians. (Fig. 1) 251 of male and 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-smokers, fron this it may be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumption per smoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for female doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors and 41 of fenale doctors who_sook vere certain that they would snoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they will quit snoking. It their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for fenale doctors. Anew feature ot the 1984 survey vas the inclusion of questions on doctors'
