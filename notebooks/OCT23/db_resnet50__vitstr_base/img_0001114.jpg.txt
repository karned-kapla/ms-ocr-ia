snouma * MOESTEO CONTACTEO WITH SKM, OA VAPOR MAALLD

Alr is nontoxlc and ls necassary to support llfe. Inhalatlon of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult in similar symptoms oj those of exposure to oxypen. Inhalationofairiin high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of alrwhere the panlal pressure oforygen la in excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of tingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur.
bances, abnomaa sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confuslon and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to nigh-pressure environments
Facilities at which air la breathed 5 high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons)
should 8 prepared to deal with llinesses resulting from decompresslon. Decompression equipment may be required.
