Dear Mr. Todd:

In recent talks with Dr. Carl G. Baker, Director
of the National Cancer Institute, the desirability
of forming an international study group concerned
with research into tobacco and health problems
was discussed. This letter is to invite you on
behalf of your organization to participate in this
The proceedings will aim at providing the relatively
few active investigators in tobacco. and health
research programs with an opportunity to discuss
freely current and future research programs with
the intent of reaching common objectives more quickly.
The group will be composed of investigators primarily
involved in tobacco and health research oriented towards
producing less harmful smoking products. The partici-
pants must be both willing and able to share with
other investigators what is being learned from their
current activities and openly discuss plans for future
research in the field. It is thought that by bringing
such a dnozb of experts together to review ongoing
studies and to plan future investigations jointly less
harmful tobacco products will be available sooner and
costly research projects will not be duplicated unneces-
sarily. The meetings would be held at yearly intervals
with the different organizations acting as host.
