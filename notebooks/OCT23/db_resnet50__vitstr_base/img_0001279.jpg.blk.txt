Sumarry: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C was investigated with various synthetic products. t1o*B0k1EXAwopsppeze2----Ao**ess- a major species of diacylglycerol derived trom the receptor-mediated EreAtoxpAq of inositol phospho- lipids, : most active, but many other discyiglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this role. Hormone-sansitive 1ipase could produce potentially active diacyiglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stsaroyl-arachidonyl spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the membrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources 5 produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase c to modulate many Ca2*-dependent cellular processes (1).
