Sample Letter Concerned Citizen April 1998 The Honorable Office Address Washington, D.C. Dear Senator or Representative
United States Senate/or/United States House ofRepresentatives
I am writing to express my strong opposition to S. 1415, Senator John McCain's tobacco legislation. As a concemnd citizen, I am offended by many aspects ofthis legislation, including unfair taxes, the creation of a black market and sweeping FDA The McCain bill constitutes modem day Prohibition. The FDA would have discretion under the McCain legislation to ban tobacco products immediately without any Congressional action. The FDA is an unelected federal agency that should not be given unfettered authority to ban tobacco. Tohacco prohibition would foster an immediate black market and smuggling operations -creating a boon for organized crime. A ban on tobacco products also would be a crippling blow on many communities whose economic stability depends on the tobacco industry. Hundreds ofthousands of people have jobs linked to the production, distribution and retailing oftobacco products. High cigarette taxes will cause job losses in every sector ofthe tobacco industry - from Iam a hard-working taxpayer, and I support legislation that keeps tobacco products out ofthe hands of: minors. However, I strongly oppose any bill that infringes on an adult's right to smoke a legal product. Adults make dn 98 percent of all smokers in the United States, and they will bear the burden of the huge tax increases proposed by I encourage you to vote against the McCain bill and any legislation that mirrors the devastating effects of the McCain bill. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
