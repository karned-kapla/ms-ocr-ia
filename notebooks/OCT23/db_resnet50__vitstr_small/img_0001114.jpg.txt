Alr is nontoxlc and in necassary to support life. Inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult in similar symptoms 03 those of exposure to oxygen. inhalationofairin: high-pressure
environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of slrwhere the parial pressure oforygen is in excess of two atmospheres may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manilestations Including tingling of tingers and toes, visua! and acoustica! distur.
bances, abnomma sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscie twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
