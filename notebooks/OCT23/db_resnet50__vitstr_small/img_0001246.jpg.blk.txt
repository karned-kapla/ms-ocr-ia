Clinton have tried to harness the widespread malaise among voters and offer hope for the future, Mr. Clinton by invoking "change' at every opportunity, and Mr. Bush by promising that his poll- cies areon the brink of yielding significant A close look at several people who have seen their confidence in the future erode suggests why there is such widespread disillusionment with the American dream. But not everyone is grim. Those who have come from the poorest backgrounds or encountered the greatest hardships seem to retain the most hope. "Everyone Seems Defeated' When Mark Donnelly came of age in the 1960s, no problem seemed insoluble. In 1962, as a 20-year-old Army private, Mr. Donnelly went t Oxford, Miss., to protect James Meredith, whose enrollment at the University of Mississippi sparked race riots. For a week.

Statistically, Americans, both rich and poor, are improving their lots. Their buying power has doubled since the 1950s, and their standard of living remains the highest in the world.
