- 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors vas used to update earlier conclusions fron
sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of nembers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed
questionnaire, 435 fenale and 969 nale physicians. As smoking varies systrmatic.
ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted to match the doctors" age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.

RESILTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers. whereas in the Norwegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to
411 of all Norwegian wonen. There secns to be a widening dvb betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are nore marked in the younger
agc groups, and berause nore doctors than lay persons want to quit snoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who smoke, both withip and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. Thr decrease in smoking buoNe males is much stcrper buone doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Snoking proportions : increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply anong fenale physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of male and 151 of femal doctors are now ex-ssokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per snoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their snoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors who_sooke vere certain that they would snoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vonen think it likely or certain that they
vill quit smoking. It their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
Anew feature ot the 1984 survey vas the inclusion of questions on doctors'
