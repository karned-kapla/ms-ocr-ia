Sumaryy: Specificity of 1,3-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase C was investigated vith various synthetic products.

lipids, : most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturaily occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this
role. Hormone-sansitive 1ipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the possibility that the stsaroyl-arachidonyl

comes in contact in the nembrane vhen the receptor is stimulated,
