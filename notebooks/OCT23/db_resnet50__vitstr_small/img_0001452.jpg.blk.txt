-riginal Message- From: Ostern, Eric Sent: Wednesday, February 07, 2001 5:32 PM To: Daragan, Karen M. Subject: FW: draft proposal Importance: High Karen- anyway we can do it then???7 Three topline thougts on my end:
See note below from Greg. We need 1 discuss before I get back 1 him and - know that tomorrow is tight but is there 1) Budget breakdown--I thought it would be more along the lines of $50-S65M but we'll need him to justify. 2) Would like to discuss the whole RFP process as Ihave some concerns about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the $$$ is primarily awarded from PM YSP-maybe our best bet is to give them the funds to award and theyhandle it 3) The timeline seems quito long-I thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound of n there is stil work that needs to be done ---hiih is actually ok, but I'm not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting wi the BOD Let me know If you think wo can ozoonbs this in tomorrow or if our discussion needs to take place on Monday, - can
soup to nuts so-to-speak. However, there are Issues if it's done that way as well,
(4/1-4/20) vs. a single presentation to the BOD.
