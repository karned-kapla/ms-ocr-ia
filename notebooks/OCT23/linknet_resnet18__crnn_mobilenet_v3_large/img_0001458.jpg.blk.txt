think there will be a desire by many in Congress 0 "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventuallv materializes, which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such. they may be looking for "filler, and a hearing is a good example of a way to stay busy In DC. Ithink it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can delve into and get better personal news coverage. while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never
know!
