We are looking fonard to your active participation in the scientific activities of the La Jolia rescirch cocmunity In particular, the activities of the La Jolla Cancer Resezrch Fouuration and your studies on alkaline pnosphatase isoenzymes should fit in well with ongoing activities not only at UCSD but also at Scripps The establisnrent of a focal center for research proorams on oncodevelopmental prublems is particularly irely. It will be 0! o-at potential importance for pulling togetter work by a numbor of laboratories directed toward isolation, characteriztaion and doternination of the sionificance of hurian oncodevelopmenta antigens such as alphafeluprotein and Carcinuwebryonic enticens. One of the noals of the work in our laboratory is to determine the relationship of increased serura concentrations of AFP to precalignant lesions or carcinooen exposure in hunans.
