PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV 21(6) 937-941. 1984. - The naturally occurring brain peptide Tyr- MIF-1 "IIN-AD-a-T-AD) was tested for its ability to block and reverse the actions of morphine in the tail-llick test. Injected peripherally either 10 minutes before or after morphine, Tyr-MIF-1, like MIF-1. was found to significantly reduce the antinociceptive actions of morphine on thermal pain. The results indicate that Tyr-MIF- may act. in part, as an
