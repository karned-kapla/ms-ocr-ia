Estimating Genetic Parameters of Survival Distributions: A Multifactorial Model

Department of Human Genetics, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond For a number of genetically influenced illnesses, age of onset is correlated between relatives. In some cases, age of onset also serves as an index of an individual's inheritedi liabiliry to ue illness. Typically, survival models for age of onset distri- butions do not allow for these effects. We have used the gamma distribution as the basis of - model which specifies genetic variability in age of onset. Specifically, we allow the hazard frequency parameser of the gamma distribution to be a monotonic function of an individual ia inherited liabiliry to an illness. Simulations under various gamma models indicate that age of onset correlations may be strikingly different from correlations in liabiliry. Maximum likelihood estimation procedures were used o obtain parameter estimates from simulated data sets and 01 deiermine whether h ia possible o discriminate between different order. The results for 1,000 pairs of twins (500 monozygotie and 500 dirygotic) gave parameter estimates that were fairly accurate but that decreased in precision as the order of the gamma process increased. We discuss the effect chis may have on inferences made about age of onset. Key words: age of onset correlations, survival models, gamma distribution

INTRODUCTION
Genetic analyses of illnesses and behaviors showing a variable age of onset require 2 knowledge of the cumulative probability of onset given approach√©s [Weinberg, 1915; Stromgren, 1938; Risch, 1983) derive this probability from prior age of onset distributions. Others [Elston, 1973: Heimbuch et al., 1980; Risch, 1983] estimate parameters of a cumulative age of onset distribution from the data. When the data allow its use, the latter method is more appealing since specific
