model for studying the dysregulation of cell cy-
cle progression. This highly metastatic tumor
accounts for 25-30% of all lung cancers and
causes > 25 000 deaths annually in the United
States (Birrer and Minna, 1989). SCLC cells ex-
press receptors for several autocrine growth
factors, including gastrin-releasing peptide
(GRP, homologous to amphibian bombesini
(Cuttitta et al., 1985: Carney et al., 1987), insulin-
like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (Macauly et al., 1988:
Nakanishi et al., 1988b), and a transferrin-like
molecule (Nakanishi et al., 1988a; Vostrejs et

gers, which must converge on a common point
In addition to receptors for peptide growth
factors, some SCLC cell lines express musca-
rinic (Sorenson et al., 1983; Cunningham et al.,
1985; Williams and Lennon, 1990a) and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (Maneckjee and Minna
1990). The ability of acetylcholine receptors to
regulate cell proliferation has recently been
(Conklin et al., 1988: Ashkenazi et
al., 1989; Maneckjee and Minna, 1990). Based
on our finding that activation of M, muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors (MAChR) causes hy-
drolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) and inhibits
voltage-gated Ca?* channe activity in SCLC
cells, we proposed that MAChR activation may
affect SCLC proliferation (Williams and Lennon,
1990a). We report here that mAChR activation
inhibits DNA synthesis induced by serum, bom-
besin, insulin, or IGF-I in SCLC cells. MAChR
agonists arrest SCLC cells in both S and G,/M
phases of the cell cycle. mAChR activation ap-
pears to disrupt a common event induced by
different growth factors, which follows signal

SCLC cells, mAChR activation inhibits DNA synthe-

In normal cells, the transition from proliferation
to terminal differentiation is marked by with-
drawal from the cell cycle and an inability to
reenter the cycle in response to growth factors.
Transformed cells do not undergo this transi-
tion, but constitutively remain in the cell cycle;
the regulation of cell cycle progression is dis-
rupted (Heldin and Westermark, 1984; Wein-
