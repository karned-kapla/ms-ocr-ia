The role of cathepsin L in malignant transformation

Procathepsin 2 is the major excreted protein of malignantty What is MEP? The first hint as to the idendification of transformed mouse fibroblasts and it is one of the major MEP came from studies in which MEP was shown to acid cysteine proteases in mammalian cells.
