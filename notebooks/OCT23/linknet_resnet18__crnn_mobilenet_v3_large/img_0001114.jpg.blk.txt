Alr is nontoxle and is necassary to support Ilfe. inhalation of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist in hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of. alr in high-pressure andronments € also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-oressure environments of alr where the partia pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmospheres may pro duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustical distur- bances, a bnoral sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twitching and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure anvironments Facilities at which air is breathed i5 high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons should be prepared to deal with linestes resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be recuired.
