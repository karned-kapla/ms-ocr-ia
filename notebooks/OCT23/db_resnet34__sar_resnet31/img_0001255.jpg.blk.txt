DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS ALISON THORNTON, PETER LEE* and Join FRY P. N. 3 Statistics and Computing Led, EUR Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Recrived b restsed form 8 March 1994) Abstract-The extent to which current, ex- and passive smoking are associated with other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studiod using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 33 lifestyle factors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, docreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased in passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated It le concluded that confounding by multipke risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak associations are obscrved. This applies particularly os studies investigating the possible association of pasive smoking with various heakh effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
