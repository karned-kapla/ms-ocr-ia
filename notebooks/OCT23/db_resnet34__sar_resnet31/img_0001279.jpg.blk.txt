Surmary: Specificity of 1.2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C was investigated vith various synthetic products. i-stearoyl---achidonylglycerol. e major species of diacylglycerol derived trom € recaptor-mediated "goktorpiq of inositol phospho- lipids, was most active, but many other diacylglycerols having Daturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially aotive diacylglycerola during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stearoyl-arachidonyl spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the nembrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that diacylglycerols from other sources : produced in dis- tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolvsis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2+ "-dependent cellular processes (1).
