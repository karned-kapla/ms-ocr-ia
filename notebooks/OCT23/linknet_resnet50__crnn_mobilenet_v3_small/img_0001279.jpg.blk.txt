Sum ry: Specificity of 1,3-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C was investicated vith various synthetic products. aroy. rarscbl@umyiptyessol a major species of diacylglycerol derived from tha receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids, vas most active, but many other discylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost equally active in this role. Bormone-senzitive lipase could produce potentially active diacyigiycerole during lipolysis. The lack of : specificity may be reconciled with the possibility that the stereyl-arssmidobyl spacies is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the nambrane vhen the receptor is stimulated, and that discylglycerols from other sources are produced in dis- tinct compartaenta and are not intercalated into à phospholipid It is genarally accepted that receptor-medisted hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulata many Ca2+ -dependent cellular processes (1).
