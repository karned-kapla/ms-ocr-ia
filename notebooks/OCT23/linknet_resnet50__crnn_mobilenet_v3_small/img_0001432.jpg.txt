niques; has the greater stability inherent to pulse-
height discrimination; and reduces noise by observing
phly photo cathode impulsos which are averaged.

Ratio SPF The ratio photometer provides superior
stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer
to known spectral characteristics, partially corrects for
low intensity peak shift in far UV and increases the sig-
