Karen-
anyway we can do it then???7
Three topline thougts on my end:

20851
15:

See note below from Greg. We need to discuss before - get back to him and know that tomorrow is tight but is there
1) Budget breakdown--I thought it would be more along the lines of $50-S65M but we'll need him to justify.
2) Would like to discuss the whole RFP process as have some concems about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the
SSS is primarily awarded from PM YSP-maybe our best bet is le give them the funds to award and they handle it
3) The timeline seems quito long--1 thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound of a there ie stil
work that needs to be done --which ie actually ok, but I'm not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting w/ the BOD
Let me know if you think wo can ozoonbs this in tomorrow or if our discussion needs to take place on Monday, can

soup to nuts so-to-speak. However, there are issues it it's done that way as well,

(4/1-4/20) vs. a single presentation to the BOD.

have MM schedule.
