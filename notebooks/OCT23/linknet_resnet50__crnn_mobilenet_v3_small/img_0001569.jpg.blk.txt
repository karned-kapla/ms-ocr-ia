The presence of different monooxygenase activities has been docu- mented in buman placental microsomes. The predominating cysochrome P- 450, that of androgen aromatase, catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens [1). Aromatase P-450 has been the object of numerous studies to determine its mechanism of action and to purify it [2, 3). Gough et al. [4) reported the presence of another enzyme system which catalyzes the hydroxylation of xenobiotic substances. It has also been reported that a placental cytochrome P-450 a responsible for the hydroxylation of benzola)pyrene via aryl hydro- carbon hydroxylase "Lz-sl The low content of the responding cytochrome P. 450 in human placenta and instability during purification have made it difficult to isolate any other active P-450 enzyme. As a side beneft gained from our procedure to purify and characterize catalytically active aromatase P-450 "(cl we found a fraction from the immunoafinity chromatograph; which showed a high level of xenobiotic activity with little contaminating aromatase activity. Tbrough the use ofconventional purifcation procedures. we obtained a xenobiotically active P-450 with no aromatase activity. Previous studies on aryl hydrocarbon bydroxylase activity have demon- strated higher levels of this activity in smokers but not in nonsmokers '8) 16 "Postdoctoral Research Fellows On leave from tbe Department of Obsteincs and
