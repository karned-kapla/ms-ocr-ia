The role of cathepsin L in malignant transformation

Procathepsin 7 is the major excreted protein ef malignantly What is MEP? The first hint as to the idenoification of transformed mouse fibroblasts and it is one of the major MEP came from srudies in which MEP was shown to acid csteine broteases in mammalian cells.
