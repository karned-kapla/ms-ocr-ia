Alr is nontoxlo and is necassary to support Iife. inhalation of alr In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr in high-pressure
envdronmenta can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to highpressure environments of alr where the partlal pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmosohere: may pro-
duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur.
bances, abnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confusion, muscle twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be presant when confusion and impaired Judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facilities at which air ls breathed in high-pressure anviroemants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwate diving. and calssons)
should be prepared to deal with Illnesses resutting from decompreasion. Decompreasion equipment may be required.
