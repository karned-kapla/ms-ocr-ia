think there will be a desire by many in Congress o "stay relevant to whatever war effort eventually materializes, which means to stay in DC for as long as possible. As such, they may be looking for "filler. and a hearing is a good example of a way 6 stay busy lm DC think it is unlikely, given that there are a lot of more timely issues members can deive into and get better personal news coverage. while any action on our issues is likely to get buried, but you never
