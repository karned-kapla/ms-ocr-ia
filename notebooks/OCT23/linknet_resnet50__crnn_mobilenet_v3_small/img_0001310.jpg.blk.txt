National Council on Seoking and Health. P.0. Box 8025 Dep Oslo : Norvay 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vaS used to update carlier conclusions fton sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first tim questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind saaple of nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the nailed questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians. As saoking varies systrmatic ally by age, the general population v1S ageadjusted 03 satch the doctors' 490 distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper nay
therefore differ fron official Norwegian figures.
RESULTS: Sroking Habits:
In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere snokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula tion at large 461 were snokers. Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to 411 of all Norvegian vonen. There secas to be a widening dvb between the doctors and the lay population, because the differences : nore narked in the younger agc groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons vant to quit saoking. In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both within and across age cohorts.

Saoking proportions are increasing in the female population, and reducing sharply BuoRe female physicians. (Fig. 11 251 of sale and 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-ssokers, fron this it nay be inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho continue snoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumption per smoker was 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost identical to the doctors' con- sumption in 1974 and 01 the consumption of the general population in 1984. Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of sale doctors and 41 of female doctors whossoke vere certain that they would ssoke in 1989, whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the sonen think it likely or certain that they will quit anoking. If their oun predictions were true, the overall rates of snoking in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
