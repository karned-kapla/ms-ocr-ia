Intracellular signal transduction pathways have central roles in processes
such as growth, differentiation, neurotransmission and development. The
aberrant expression of components of various signal transduction pathways
has profound consequences for cellular functions. Recent findings indicate
that many cases of neoplasia and inherited diseases have, at their roots,
mutations in key steps of signalling pathways.

Introduction

Troubles in the nucleus

A prerequisite for normal cell growth and differentiation
ia that 8 cell must be able to receive, interpret and re-
the extemal interface of the cell that bears many elements
required for the primary analysis of such signals. Among
these elements are membrane receptors that are able to
interact specifically with a variety of compounds. Binding
of a ligand to its receptor initiates a cascade of events that
modulate a variety of cellular functions including the con-
a given stimulus, Aberrations in this process can lead to
deregulated cell proliferation and ultimately tumourige-
nesis. Two major signal transduction pathways, which
use cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) and dia-
cylglycerol (DAG) as secondary messengers, exist (1,2,3).
Each pathway  characterized by its specific protein ki

ease. In this review we will focus on some key examples
that represent paradigms of this phenomenon.

In the nucleus, many transcription factors such as AP-1
[7-), NF-XB (8], CREM [-6] and SRF (10] have been iden-
and Jun for AP-1 [7-), and Rel for NF-XB (11). Yet other
oncogenic products have been found to have important
functions at the level of gene regulation, as in the cases
of Myc, Myb and ErbA (12-). Correct transcription initia-
tion relies upon cooperation between these various fac
