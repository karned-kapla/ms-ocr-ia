The intervention was carried out on two levels: (a) an intensive interven- tion (II) in two schools and (b) a county-wide intervention (CI) in the rest of North Karelia. two schools to represent the CI and two schools from a reference county (R). 851 children. their parents, and their teachers were studied at the outset in 1978 and after the intervention in 1980. During the program the proportion of boys reporting to smoke at least 1-2 times per month increased 12.6% in IL. 8.2% in C and 29.7% ie the R schools (P < 0.001 between II and RJ and in girls 9.0%, 18.0%8 and 20.0%, respectively. 5 v 0.05 between II and R). The mean serum total cholesterol was 5.1 mmol/liter in 1978 and it decreased among boys 0.5 mmoVliter in all three school groups. Among girls. the decrease was 0.43 mmolliter (II), 0.35 mmolliter (CI), and 0.21 mmol/liter (R) ( A 0.01 between Il and R). The mean amount of fat from milk and butter changed among boys -8 R (II), 0 E (CI), and +3 & (R) and among girls effect on blood pressure although there was some reported reduction in the salt consump- tion in the intervention schools. A relative decrease according to the intervention level was ob- served among North Karelian children in occurrence of psychosomatic symptoms. The effects were not related to increases in bealth knowledge or changes in attitudes and did not lead, on Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major, singular public health problem in most of the industrial worid, but especially le Finland (6, 11). A number of -oud spective studies have indicated that possibilities for CVD prevention lie in reduc- tion of well established risk factors: smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, and hypertension (6, 18, 22). Several preventive trials among adults are under way to test the hypothesis that risk factor reduction in the population will lead to reduced mortality and morbidity from CVD (17, 25, 29). Data from the North Karelia have indicated that an innovative community-based program can lead to a This work has been aided by grants from the Finnish National Board of Health and National
