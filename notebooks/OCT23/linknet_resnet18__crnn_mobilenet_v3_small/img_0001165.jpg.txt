IrsD. Gtrolame, Soush Ordinge,
I'm aware that my answer is going to
drive everyone crary, but I'm going
torisk i anyway: It will take him 30
days. To explain, let's suppose thas
the well à caly 2 foet doep. How
many days will it take him e jump
out? Less than one, because he can
land a the bottom, then jump up to
the edge and climb right out without
sliding back at all. If the well is 3
foet doep. bowevez, he'll jump up 2
foet A slide down one during the
fint 24-bour period, then jump out -
wheo the next day arrives, with only
one full day behind him If the well
is4 foet deep, il take tim two
days, and so 00 the number of days
always being two less than the feet.
