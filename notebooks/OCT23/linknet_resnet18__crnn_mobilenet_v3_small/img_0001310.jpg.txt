siailar surveys in 1952' and 1974?. The 1984 survey included for the first tim
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample ot nenbers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the nailed
questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians. As saoking varies systrnatic
ally la age, the general population v45 ageadjusted to satch the doctors' 490
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper pay

therefore differ fron official Nozwegian figures.

Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokers Only 11.41 of fenale doctors snoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vonen. There secas to be widening gAp betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are sore narked in the younger
age groups, and because nore doctors than lay persons MAnt to quit snoking.

251 of sale And 151 of fenale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it nay be
inferred that 2. 400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The mean consumption
per snoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alnost ident ical to the doctors' con-
suaption in 1974 And to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
When asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of sale doctors
and 41 of female doctors who snoke vere certain that they would ssoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the sosen think it likely or certain that they
will quit smoking. If their oun predictions were true, the overall rates of
buryons in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
