The role of cathepsin L in malignant transformation

Procathebsin 7 is the major excreted prolein ef malignantly What is MEP? The first hint as to the idennification of transformed mouse fibroblasts and it is one of the major MEP came from srudies in which MEP was shown to acid cysteine broteases in mammalian cells.
