For a number of genetically influenced illnesses, age of onset is correlated between
relatives. In some cases, age of onset also serves as an index of an individual's
inherited liabiliry to ue illness. Typically, survival models for age of onset distri-
butions do not allow for these effects. We have used the gamma distribution as the
basis of - model which specifies genetic variabiliry is age of onset. Specifically,
we allow the hazard frequency parameter of the gamma distribution to be a
monotonic function of an individual a inherited liability to an illness. Simulations
under various garruma models indicate that age of onset correlations may be
strikingly different from correlations in liability. Maximum likelihood estimation
procedures were used oo obtain parameter estimates from simulated data sets and
01 determine whether it a possible o discriminate between
different order. The results for 1,000 pairs of twins (500 monozygotie and 500
dirygotic) gave parameter estimates that were fairly accurate but that decreased in
precision as the order of the gamma process increased. We discuss the effect chis
may have on inferences made about age of onset.

INTRODUCTION

Genetic analyses of illnesses and behaviors showing a variable age of onset
require a knowledge of the cumulative probability of onset given
approach√®s [Weinberg, 1915; Stromgren, 1938; Risch, 1983) derive this probability
from prior age of onset distributions, Others (Elston, 1973: Heimbuch et al., 1980;
Risch, 1983) estimate parameters of a cumulative age of onset distribution from the
data. When the data allow its use, the latter method is more appealing since specific
