Alr is nontoxlo and is necassary to support Iife. inhalation of alr In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of. alr In high-pressure andronmenti € also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure anvironments of alr where the partlal pressure of orygen Is in excess of two atmosohere: may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur. bances, a boormal sensations, Impalred coordination. confusion, muscle twitching and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be presant when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure anvironments Facilities at which air ls breathed 5 high-pressure environments (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving, and calssons should be prepared to deal with Ilineszes resulting from decompreasion. Decompression equipment may be required.
