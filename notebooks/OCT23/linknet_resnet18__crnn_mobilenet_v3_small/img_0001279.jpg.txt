Summary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinaae was investigated with various synthetic products.

derived from tha receptor-sediated hydrolysia of inositol phospho-
lipids was most active, but many other discylglycerole having
naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this
role. Bormone-sensitive lipase could produce potentially active
discylgiycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the spacifici a
