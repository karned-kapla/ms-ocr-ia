smokers showed significantly greater prevalence than nonsmokers of Type A personality traits,

IN RECENT years. many published studies have shown an association that suggests a role
for psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of CHD [. 2]. In the Framingham Study.
univariate and multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship of certain psycho-
social factors to CHD and also to cigurette smoking (3-5). The pervasive yuestion of
temporal precedence and a priori sef-selection still requires further clarification. however.
In the absence of controlled experiments. the effects of cigarette smoking on health have
been inferred from abservational studies that compare persons who smoke with
nonsmokers. In these comparisons. the disease outcomes are assumed to occur in cohorts
of smokers and nonsmokers who were initially similar in all relevant characteristics except
for the difference in smoking habit. Very little evidence has been available. however. to
The unique data of the Child Health and Development Studies ICHDS) of the
University of Califomnia. Berkeley, provide uE opportunity to check this assumption by
examining antecedent characteristics associated with teenage smoking [6-8]. The CHDS

In this report, we have analyzed the antecedent psychosocial characteristics of a large
cohort of boys and girls before some of them later began cigarette smoking as teenagers.
