ous - MGESTEO CONTACTED - : OR VAROR INMALED

Alr is nontoxic and is necassary to support life. Inhalation of air in high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may
exist In hyperbaric chambors, canresult In similar symptoms to those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalation of alr In high-pressure
andronments € also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood whlch may result In decompression sickness.
Exposure to high-pressure environments of alr where the partial pressure of orygen Is In excess of two atmosoneres may pro-
duce - variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur.
bances, a bnormal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscle twitching and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards
may be presant when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments
Facillties at which air is breathed is high-pressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons)
should be prepared to deal with tinesses resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be required.
