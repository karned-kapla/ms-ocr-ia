For many Americans, the future seems
about as secure as a dandelion puff.
An entire generation now reaching
middle age is questioning whether they or
their children can do better than their
parents. Job security went out with three-
piece suits, and pundits have coined a new

Statistically, Americans, both rich and

Warren Bennis, a business professor at
