1984 survey on Norwegian doctors vas used to undate earlier conclusions from
sisilar surveys in 1952' and 1974? The 1984 survey included for the first timr
questions regarding doctors" intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of sembers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the mailed
questionnaire, 415 fenale and 969 nale physicians. As saoking varies systematic
ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted to match the doctors' age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper -ay

therefore differ fron official Norwegian tigures.

RESULTS:
Secking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors were smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokers Only 11.41 of female doctors saoked compared to
411 of all Norvegian vonen. There secas to be widening gap betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are sare sarked in the younger
age groups, and berause aore doctors than lay persons vant to quit snoking.
In comparison both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors uhn saoke, both within and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), with the exception of persons 65 years of age
and older. The decrease in smoking among males is auch stceper buomr doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply BUOEP feaale phycicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of nale and 151 of feaale doctors are now ex-saokers, fron this it Bay be
inferred that 2. 400 Norwegian doctors have quit smoking. the doctors vho
continue smoking have not cut down on their tobacco use. The aean consumption
per saoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for male doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for tenale doctors. This difference is alaost ident ical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of aale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors who smoke vere certain that they would smoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the vosen think it likely or certain that they
will quit smoking. If their oun predictions vere truc, the overall rates of
burxons in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
