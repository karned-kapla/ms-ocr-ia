We are looking fonard to your active participation in the scientific activities of the La Jolla rescarch coccunity In particular, the activities of the La Jolla Cancer Resezrch Founration and your studies on alkaline pnosphatase isoenzymes should fit in well with ongoing activities not only at UCSD but also at Scripps The establisnrent of a focal center for rcsearch proorams on oncodevelopmental prublems is particularly irely. It will be 0 a:01 potential importance for pulling tegether work, by a number of laboratories directed toward isolation, characteriztaion and doternination of the signiticance of huran oncodevelopmenta antigens such as alphafetoprotein and carcinoesbryonic anticens. One of the noals of the work in our laboratorv is to deternine the relationship of increased serua concentrations of AFP to preralignant lesions or carcinogen exposure in hunans.
