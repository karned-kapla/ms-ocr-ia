Girolamo, South Ordinge, I'm aware that my answer is going to drive everyone crary, but I'm going torisk i anyway: It will take him 30 days. To explain, let's suppose that the well la oaly 2 foet deep. How many days will it take him de jump out? Less than one, because he can land et the bottom, then jump up to the edge and climb right out without sliding back at all. If the well is 3 foet dotp, bowever, he'll jump up 2 foet E slide down onc during the first 24-bour period, then jump out : when the next day arrives, with only one full day behlnd him if the well is4 foet deep, k'll take him two days, and so DO. the number of days always being two less than the feet. - Ithkk we're a L 1 * lypocrites!
