G. F. Todd, Esq. Tobacco Research Council Glen House, Stag Place London, s.w.1 England
Dear Mr. Todd:
In recent talks with Dr. Carl G. Baker, Director of forming an international study group concerned with research into tobacco and health problems was discussed. This letter is to invite you on behalf of your organization to participate in this The proceedings will aim at providing the relatively few active investigators in tobacco and health research programs with an opportunity to discuss freely current and future research prograns with the intent of reaching common objectives nore quickly. The group will be composed of investigators primarily involved in tobacco and health research oriented towards producing less harmful smoking products. The partici- pants must be both willing and able to share with other investigators what is being learned from their current activities and openly discuss plans for future research in the field. It is thought that by bringing such a dnoxs of experts together to review ongoing un tudies and to plan future investigations jointly harmful tobacco products will be available sooner and costly research projects will not be duplicated unneces- sarily. The meetings would be held at yearly intervals with the different organizations acting as host.
