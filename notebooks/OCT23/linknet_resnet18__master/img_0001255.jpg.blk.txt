DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS, PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS LISON THORNTON, PETER Les* and JOIN FRY P N La Statistics and Computing Led, 17 Coder Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 SDA, England (Recewed in restred form & March 1994) Abstract A extent to which current, ex and passive smoking are associated with other risk factors, and the polential for confounding arising from these associations, was studied using a representative sample of 9003 British adults The distribution of 31 lifestyle factors generally considered associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with . smoker ("passive smokers") and other never smokers. or the 33 ritk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence in heavy smokers than in never smokers and only tuo showed a lower prevalence. For many risk fuctors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, decreased with time of smoking cessation and was increased in passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated. It is concluded that confounding by multipk risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak associations are observed. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effects. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
