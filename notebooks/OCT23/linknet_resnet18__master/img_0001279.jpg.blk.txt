Summary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase vas investigated with various synthetic products. Staaroyl- -arechidonylglycerol. major species of diacylglycerol derived from tha recaptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids was most active but many other diacylglycerols having naturally occurring fatty acids vere almost aqually active in this role. Hormone-sansitive lipase could produce potentially active diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specifici a be reconciled with the possibility that : stearoyl-arachi av spacios is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed comes in contact in the mambrane when the receptor is . timulated, and that diacylglycerola from other sources are produced in dis tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C to modulate many Ca2*-dependent cellular processes (1). However the physiological pictare as vell as the Tis investigation was supported in part by research grants fres the Scientific Research Fund of Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Japan (1986-1987), Muscular Dystrophy Association (1986-1987) Yanamouchi Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders (1986-1987) Herck Sharp .
