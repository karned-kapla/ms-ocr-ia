Intracellular signal transduction pathways have central roles .n processes
such as growth, differentiation, neurotransmission and development. The
aberrant expression of components of various signal transduction pathways
has profound consequences for cellular functions Recent findings indicate
that kuew cases of neoplasia and inherited diseases have, at their roots,
mutations is key steps of signalling pathways.
