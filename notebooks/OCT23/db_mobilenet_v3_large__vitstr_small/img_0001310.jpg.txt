A 1984 survey on Norvegian doctors vas used to urdate earlier conclusions fron
sinilar surveys in 1952' and 1974? The 1984 survey included for the first time
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of a stratifind
sample of nembers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the nailed
questionnaire, 435 female and 969 nale physicians As snoking varies systematic
ally by age, the general population vas ageadjusted 03 natch the doctors' 4ge
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fron official Norwegian fiqures.

RESILTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors vere smokers, whereas in the Norwegian popula
tion at large 461 were smokers. Only 11.41 of female doctors seoked compared to
411 of all Norwegian vonen. There secns to be a widening gap betveen the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences are sore marked in the younger
agc groups, and berause nore doctorss than lay persons vant to quit snoking.
In comparisor both to 1952 and to 1974 there vas in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both withip and across age
cohorts. (not the sane persons), wi th the exception of persons 65 ynars of age
and older. The decrease in smoking buowe males is much stcrper buone doctors
than in the Norvegian nale population. Snoking proportions are increasing in
the female population, and reducing sharply buone fenale physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of male and 151 of femal doctors are DOM ex-smokers, fron this it may be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit snoking. The doctors vho
continue smoking have bot cut down on their tobacco use. The nean consumption
per snoker vas 14 cigarettes per day for nale doctors and 12 cigarettes per day
for fenale doctors. This difference is alaost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their snoking habits in 5 years, only 111 of nale doctors
and 41 of fenale doctors who snoke vere certain that they would snoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 541 of the wonen think it likely or certain that they
vill quit smoking It their own predictions vere true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for nale doctors and 51 for fenale doctors.
