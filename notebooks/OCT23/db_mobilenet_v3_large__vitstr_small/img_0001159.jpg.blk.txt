The A5 protein is expressed in pre-B cells in association with VpreB and u-heavy chains, and is critical for differentiation to the B cell stage. Pre-B cell-specific expression of the A5 and VpreB genes is regulated at the level of transcription initiation. In this report, we have identified several DNase l-hypersensitive sites 2.5- 8 6.0-kb downstream of the A5 gene, which are present in the pre-B cel! line 70Z/3, but not in the myeloma cell line J558L. These sites, however, were shown to have no transcriptional enhancer activity as measured by transient trans- fection. Enhancer activity was identified within a 361-bp fragment (- 296 to +65, where +1 is the major 5' transcription initiation site) upstream of the mouse A5 gene. This activity 1e orientation and position independent, and .s also tissue and differentiation stage specific (active in pre-B but not B and T cells). Deletion constructs indicate that three adjacent areas (-210 to 169, -153 to 64, and 64 to - 22) are all necessary for enhancer activity. Pre-B cell-specific promoter activity was shown to reside within the -219 to + 109 fragment. Basal promoter activity resides within the 64 to +109 fragment, but is not tissue specific or stage specific. A negative element within the 101 to 64 region is active in alllymphoid cell lines tested and therefore cannot by itself be responsible for the tissue and stage specificity. The data indicate that the elements responsible for the enhancer activity 1 210 to 22) are part of the A5 gene promoter and likely confer the tissue and stage specificity via positive elements within the -210 to 22 region.
