Dear Dr. Fishwan:
and Salk.

We are looking fonard to your active participation in the scientific activities
of the La Jolla rescarch cocmunity. In particular, the activities of the La Jolla
Cancer Resezrch Founration and your studies on alkaline pnosphatase isoen:ymes
should fit in well with ongoing activities not only at UCSD but also at Scripps
The establisnrent of a focal center for rcsearch proorams on oncodevelopmental
prublems is particularly ieely. It will be of orat potential importance for
pulling tegetter work, by a number of laboratories directed toward isolation,
characteriztaion and dotorniriation of the significance of huran oncodevelopmental
antigens such as alphafetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigens.
One of the goals of the work in our laboratorv is to determine the relationship
of increased serun concentrations of Arp to preralignant lesions or carcinogen
exposure in hunans. Our studies on rats and mouse model systers clearly derion-
