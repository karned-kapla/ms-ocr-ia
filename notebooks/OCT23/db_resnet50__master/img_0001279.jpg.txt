Summary: Specificity of 1,2-diacylglycerol for the activation of
protein kinase c was investigated with various synthetic products.
'TO3POAYÉBTAROPTRDERORIT-E-PHoireis-T a major species of diacylglycerol
derived trom the recaptor-mediated ETEKTOIDA4 of inositol phospho-
lipids, € most active, but many other diacylglycerols having
naturaily occurring fatty acids vera almost aqually active in this
role. Hormone-sensitive lipase could produce potentially active
diacylglycerols during lipolysis. The lack of the specificity may
be reconciled with the posnibility that the stsaroyl-arachidosyl
spacios is the diacylglycerol with which protein kinase C indeed
comes in contact in the nembrane vhen the receptor is stimulated,
and that diacylglycerols from other sources 5 produced in dis-
tinct compartments and are not intercalated into the phospholipid
It is generally accepted that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of
inositol phospholipids produces diacylglycerol for the activation
of protein kinase c to modulate many Ca2*-dependent cellular
processes (1). Hovever, the physiological pictare : vell as the
