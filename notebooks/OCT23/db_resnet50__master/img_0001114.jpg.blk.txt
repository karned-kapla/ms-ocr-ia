Alr is nontoxic and in necassary to support life. Inhalatlon of air In high-pressure environments, such as pressures which may exist In hyperbaric chambers, canresult in similar symptoms 01 those of exposure to oxygen. Inhalationofalrin! high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of alrwhere the panial pressure oforygen is In excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations Including tingling of fingers and toes, visua! and acoustical distur. bances, abnomal sensations, Impalred coordination, confuslon, muscie twitching, and epileptiform selzures. Severe hazards may be present when confusion and impaired judgment lead to operational errors. Exposure to high-pressure environments Facillties at which air la breathed is highoressure anvironmants (eg. hyperbaric chambers, underwater diving. and calssons) should 3 prepared to deal with Ilinesses resulting from decompression. Decompression equipment may be required.
