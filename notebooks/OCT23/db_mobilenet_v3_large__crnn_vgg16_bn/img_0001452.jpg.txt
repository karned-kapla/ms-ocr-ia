Karen-
anyway wo can do it then???7
Three topline thougts on my end:

See note below from Greg. We need to discuss before get back d8 him and - know that tomorrow is tight but is there
1) Budget breakdown- thought it would be more along the lines of $50-565M but we'll need him to justify.
2) Would like to discuss the whole RFP process as have some concerns about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the
$S$ is primarily awarded from PM egkew-dSA our best bet is to give them the funds to award and they handle i
3) The timeline seems quito long-I thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound of a there is stil
work that needs to be done --which is actually ok, but l'm not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting wi the BOD
Let me know if you think wo can squoezo this in tomorrow or if our discussion needs to take place on Monday, - - can

soup to nuts so-to-speak, However there are issues # it's done that way as well.

(4/1-4/20) vs. a single presentation to the BOD.

have MM schedule.
