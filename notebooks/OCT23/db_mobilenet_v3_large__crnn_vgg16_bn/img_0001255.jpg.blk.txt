DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SMOKERS, EX-SMOKERS, PASSIVE SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS AuISON THORNTON, PETER Leg* and JOEN FRY P. N, Lae Statistics and Computing Lad, 17 Cedar Road, Sutton, Surrey ZS SDA, England (Receaed a repted forin & March 1994) Abstract-The extent 0 which current, b and passive smoking are associatod with other risk factors, and the potential for confounding arising from these associations, was studiod using a representative sample of 9003 British adults. The distribution of 33 lifestyle factors generally considerod associated with adverse health were compared in current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers living with a smoker ("passive smokens") and other never smokers. or the 33 risk factors 27 showed a significantly higher prevalence le heavy smokers than in never smokers and only two showed a lower prevalence. For many risk factors, prevalence increased with amount smoked, decreasod with time of smoking cessation and was increased ie passive smokers. The possible magnitude of bias from confounding by the risk factors is estimated It is concluded that confounding by multipke risk factors may be an important issue in smoking studies where weak associations are obscrved. This applies particularly to studies investigating the possible association of passive smoking with various health effocts. Smoking Passive smoking Confounding Bias
