Photon Counting SPF A very practical tool of great usable range le 200 to 650 nanometers for corrected
value in those applications which are sensitivity-or excitation spectra, and 290 to 700 nanometers for cor-

scatter-limited. This instrument detects fluorescence rected emission spectra.

Ratio SPF The ratio photometer provides superior
stability, brings excitation and emission spectra closer
to known spectral characieristecs.partaly corrects for
