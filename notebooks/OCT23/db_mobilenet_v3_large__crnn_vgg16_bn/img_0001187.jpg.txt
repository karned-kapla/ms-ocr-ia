MIF-1 Tyro-Le-dy-NIL, was tested for its ability to block and reverse the actions of morphine E the tail-ick test.
Injected peripherally either ls minutes before of after morphine, Tyr-MIF-I, like MIF-1, was found to significantly reduce
the antinociceptive actions of morphine on thermai pain. The results indiçate that TVE-MIF- may act, in part, as an

endogennus opiate antaponist.
