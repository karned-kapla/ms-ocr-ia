Inhalation of alr In high-pressure environments can also result In accumulation of nitrogen In the blood which may result In decompression sickness. Exposure to high-pressure environments of al where the partlal pressure of orygen le in excess of two atmospheres may pro- duce a variety of central nervous system manifestations including tingling of fingers and toes, visual and acoustica! distur bances, abnormal sensations, impalred coordination, confuslon. muscle twltching, and et pileptiform selzures.
