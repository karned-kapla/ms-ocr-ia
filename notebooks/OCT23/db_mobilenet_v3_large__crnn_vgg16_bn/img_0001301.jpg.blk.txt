No elenente substance, not even halldes or ozone hos any odor; Instead they react with the nucoss foraing new products whlch are smellod; but - Sone odorants have sterlc or vibrational propertles which force the concluslon that they are odor less when they are not. 11. TF Present evidence strongly suggests thet different parts of the olfactory receptor ares, IIke the retina In the eye, are quallty-speific. T Odorants need not penetrate the mucous (liquid system) nor the receptor No one yet has a fir clue as fo the criticol reletion between the molecule and the receptor which permits an odor perception.
