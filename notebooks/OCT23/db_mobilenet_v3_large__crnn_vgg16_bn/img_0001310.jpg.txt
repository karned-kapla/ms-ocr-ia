A 1984 survey on Norwegian doctors was used to update earlier conclusions from
sisilar surveys in 1952' and 19747 The 1984 survey included for the first tin
questions regarding doctors' intervention with patients. 911 of à stratifind
sample of seabers of the Norwegian Medical Assosiation responded to the sailed
questionnaire, 435 female and 969 male physicians. As saoking varies systematic
ally by age, the general population Mas ageadjusted o match the doctors' age
distribution. The figures given for the general population in this paper may

therefore differ fros official Norwegian figures.

RECULTS:
Sroking Habits:

In 1984, 18.61 of sale doctors were smokers, whereas in the Norvegian popula
tion at large 461 were ssokers. Only 11.41 of female doctors saoked compared to
411 of all Norwegian vonen. There seeas to be a widening gap between the doctors
and the lay population, because the differences àre are marked in the younger
age groups, and because more doctors than lay persons want to quit smoking.
In comparisor both to 1952 and to 1974 there MAs in 1984 a further considerable
decrease in the proportion of doctors who saoke, both withip and across age
cohorts. (not the sase persons), wi h the exception of persons 65 ysars of age
and older. The decrease in smoking buone males is much sterper buose doctors
than in the Norvegian sale population. Smoking proportions are increasing in
the feaale population, and reducing sharply suose female physicians. (Fig. 1)
251 of sale and 151 of feaale doctors are noM ex-smokers, from this ie may be
inferred that 2.400 Norwegian doctors have quit seoking. The doctors who
continue smoking have Dot cut down on their tobacco -s. The -An consumption
per saoker sas 14 cigarettes per day for sale doctors and 2 cigarettes per day
for fesale doctors. This difference is almost identical to the doctors' con-
sumption in 1974 and to the consumption of the general population in 1984.
Vhen asked to predict their seoking habits in 5 yeArs, only 111 of sale doctors
and 41 of female doctors who. sRoke were certain that they would ssoke in 1989,
whereas 401 of the : and 545 of the women think it likely or certain that they
will quit saoking IE their own predictions were true, the overall rates of
smoking in 1989 vould be 111 for male doctors and 51 for fesale doctors.
